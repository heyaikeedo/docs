## Introduction

Aikeedo's billing system manages user access and resource allocation through plans, snapshots, and subscriptions. This guide explains how these components work together.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the details, let's familiarize ourselves with some key terms:

- **Workspace**: A collaborative environment where users can access Aikeedo's features and resources.
- **Plan**: A predefined set of features, tools, and credit allocations offered to users.
- **Subscription**: An agreement that grants a workspace access     to a specific plan for a set duration.
- **Snapshot**: A frozen copy of a plan's details at the time a subscription is created.
- **Credits**: The currency used within Aikeedo to access various features and resources.

## Workspaces and Subscriptions

<Info>
  Subscriptions are tied to workspaces, not individual users. This allows for flexible team collaboration and resource sharing.
</Info>

Here's how workspaces and subscriptions interact:

- Each user can own multiple workspaces.
- Each workspace can have its own subscription, independent of other workspaces.
- Multiple members can be added to a workspace, sharing the same set of credits and features.
- Billing details are managed separately for each workspace.

This structure allows for great flexibility in how teams and individuals use Aikeedo, catering to various organizational structures and project needs.

## Plan Types

Aikeedo offers several plan types to suit different user needs:

### Monthly Plans
- Billed automatically every month.
- Provides monthly recurring usage credits.
- Credits reset every 30 days.

### Yearly Plans
- Single annual payment for a year's access.
- Despite yearly billing, credits are still allocated and reset monthly.
- Often comes with a discount compared to monthly billing.

### Lifetime Plans
- One-time payment for indefinite access.
- Monthly recurring credits that reset each month.
- Provides long-term value for committed users.

### Add-on Credits
- Non-recurring, permanent extra credits.
- Can be purchased at any time to supplement an active subscription.
- Used only after regular, recurring credits are depleted.
- Requires an active subscription (free or paid) to be usable.
- Cannot have separate feature configurations.

<Warning>
  Add-on credits cannot be used without an active subscription, even if they've been purchased.
</Warning>

## Plan Snapshots and Subscriptions

When a user subscribes to a plan, Aikeedo creates a snapshot:

- A snapshot is a read-only copy of the plan at the subscription time.
- It ensures that subscribers retain the features and terms they signed up for, even if the original plan is later modified.

### Updating Plans and Snapshots

- Modifying a plan does not automatically affect existing subscriptions.
- To update current subscriptions (plan snapshots), check the "Update snapshots" checkbox when saving plan changes.

<Tip>
  Be cautious when updating snapshots, as it will affect all current subscribers to that plan. Consider communicating changes in advance.
</Tip>

## Plan Customization

Aikeedo allows for granular control over what each plan offers:

- Tools, models, assistants, and writer templates can be individually toggled on or off for each plan.
- This allows you to create tiered offerings or specialized plans for different user segments.

## Credit System

Aikeedo uses a unified credit system to manage resource usage:

- Credits are the primary currency for accessing features and resources.
- Regular plans (Monthly, Yearly, Lifetime) provide recurring credits that reset periodically.
- Add-on credits supplement regular credits and don't expire, providing extra flexibility.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review your plan offerings to ensure they meet your users' needs.
- Communicate clearly about what each plan includes and how credits work.
- Consider offering a mix of plan types to cater to different user preferences and budgets.
- Use add-on credits as a way to upsell without requiring users to change their base subscription.

By understanding and effectively utilizing Aikeedo's plan and subscription system, you can create a flexible, user-friendly billing structure that grows with your business and satisfies your customers' needs.
