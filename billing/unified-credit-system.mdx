## Introduction

Aikeedo v2.0 introduces a Unified Credit System, simplifying usage management across all features. This system replaces the previous multiple unit types (tokens, image count, and audio seconds) with a single, versatile unit: Credits.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Usage Tracking**: All usage is now measured in credits, making it easier to manage and understand user consumption.
- **Flexible Credit Conversion**: Administrators can define custom credit conversion ratios for different features and AI providers.
- **Improved Plan Management**: Simplifies the process of creating and managing subscription plans with a unified credit allocation.

## How It Works

### Credit Conversion

Credits are used as a universal currency within the Aikeedo platform. Each action (text generation, image creation, audio processing etc.) consumes a specific number of credits based on the defined conversion ratios.

### Setting Conversion Ratios

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to Settings in the left sidebar.
3. Under the Finance section, click on "Credit ratios".
4. Here, you'll find options to set credit costs for various AI models.
5. For each AI model, you can set the credit cost for their specific models or actions.
6. Ensure all fields are filled with appropriate values.
7. The Save button will only become active once all fields have been filled.
8. After filling in all fields and reviewing your changes, click the now-active Save button to apply the new ratios.

<Note>
  The Save button remains inactive until all credit ratio fields are filled. This ensures that no incomplete or potentially erroneous configurations are saved.
</Note>

## Credit Calculator

To assist with setting up your credit system, we provide a Credit Calculator tool:

- Available as a Google Sheets document in the Commercial folder of your Aikeedo package
- Free for Extended/Commercial License users
- Helps calculate optimal credit conversion ratios based on your costs and desired pricing

<Tip>
  Use the calculator to ensure your credit pricing aligns with your operational costs and profit margins. You can find the Credit Calculator in the [Commercial folder](/get-started/commercial-resources) of your Aikeedo package.

## Benefits of the Unified Credit System

1. **Simplified User Experience**: Users deal with a single currency (credits) across all platform features.
2. **Flexible Pricing Models**: Easily create varied plans with different credit allocations.
3. **Easy Resource Management**: Monitor and control resource usage across all features from a single dashboard.
4. **Adaptable to New Features**: As new AI capabilities are added, they can be easily integrated into the existing credit system.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and adjust your credit conversion ratios to reflect changes in AI service costs.
- Communicate clearly to users how credits are consumed for different actions.
- Use the credit system to create tiered plans that cater to different user needs and usage patterns.

By leveraging the Unified Credit System, you can create more flexible and user-friendly subscription plans while simplifying your platform's usage management. This system provides the foundation for scalable and adaptable pricing strategies as your Aikeedo platform grows and evolves.
