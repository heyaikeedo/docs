## General Settings

### Billing Address

Control whether billing address information is required during checkout.

- **Enabled**: Billing address will be required at checkout
- **Disabled**: Billing address is optional

<Note>
  Address information is required by payment gateways in some countries for compliance and fraud prevention.
</Note>

### Credit Overuse Allowance

Manage how overused credits are handled when users exceed their plan limits.

- **Enabled**: Overused credits are tracked as workspace debt and automatically deducted from future subscription renewals or credit purchases
- **Disabled**: Overused credits become lost revenue that cannot be recovered

<Info>
  This feature helps recover revenue from overused credits while still maintaining usage limits. Workspaces with negative balance are still blocked from new operations until debt is covered.
</Info>

### Charge for Automatic Title Generation

Control whether automatic title generation incurs a cost.

- **Enabled**: Title generation incurs a cost and is charged to the workspace
- **Disabled**: Title generation is provided free of charge

### Charge for Dictation

Control whether dictation features incur a cost.

- **Enabled**: Dictation incurs a cost and is charged to the workspace
- **Disabled**: Dictation is provided free of charge

### Default Currency

Choose the default currency for your billing system. This setting affects how prices are displayed and transactions are processed throughout your Aikeedo platform.

<Tip>
  While it's important to choose a currency supported by your payment gateway, Aikeedo offers flexibility in currency handling. Each payment gateway provides a currency selector with supported currencies. If a selected currency isn't directly supported, Aikeedo can convert it to a supported currency during checkout, provided a currency rate provider is set up.
</Tip>

<Note>
  If the currency option is not set or is set to "Inherit" for payment gateways, the default currency will be used. Ensure you have a currency rate provider configured if you plan to use currencies not directly supported by your payment gateway.
</Note>

### Currency Rate Provider

Select a provider for currency exchange rates. Options include:

- **None**: No automatic currency conversion.
- **CurrencyAPI**: Uses the CurrencyAPI service for up-to-date exchange rates.

<Note>
  Additional currency providers can be added through plugins, expanding your options for managing multi-currency transactions.
</Note>

## Trial Configuration

### Trial Period Days

Set the duration of the trial period for new users. 

- Enter the number of days for the trial period.
- Set to 0 to disable the trial feature.

<Info>
  Each user is eligible for a trial only once across any paid plan.
</Info>

### Trial Without Payment

Toggle this option to allow users to start a trial without providing payment information upfront.

- When enabled, users can upgrade to any paid plan during the trial without immediately providing payment details.
- After the trial ends, a payment method will be required to continue the subscription.

## Default & Fallback Plans

### Sign Up Plan

Select the plan to which new users will be automatically subscribed upon registration.

- Choose "None" to disable automatic subscription, requiring users to select a plan themselves.
- Only monthly or yearly recurring plans can be set as the Sign-Up plan.

<Info>
  New users are automatically subscribed to the Sign Up plan, regardless of the trial option. If a trial period is set, users will be downgraded to the Fallback plan after the trial ends. Without a trial, users continue on the Sign Up plan.
</Info>

<Warning>
  If selecting a paid plan as the Sign Up plan, it's crucial to enable the trial period. Otherwise, new users will have immediate access to paid features without payment, which could lead to potential revenue loss.
</Warning>

### Fallback Plan

Define the plan users will be automatically moved to if their current subscription expires or fails to renew.

- Choose "None" to disable automatic downgrading, requiring users to manually select a new plan.
- Only monthly or yearly recurring plans can be set as the Fallback plan.

<Note>
  Ensure you have created appropriate pricing plans before configuring the Sign-Up and Fallback plans to provide a smooth user experience.
</Note>

## Custom Credit Purchases

### Enable Custom Credit Purchases

Allow users to purchase additional credits beyond their subscription plan.

- **Enabled**: Users can purchase additional credits with custom amounts
- **Disabled**: Users can only use credits included in their subscription plan

### Credits per USD

Set the exchange rate for credit purchases.

- Enter the number of credits users receive per USD spent
- Example: 100 credits per $1.00 USD

### Minimum Purchase Amount

Set the minimum amount users must spend when purchasing credits.

- Enter the minimum purchase amount in your default currency
- Example: $10.00 USD minimum purchase

### Maximum Purchase Amount

Set the maximum amount users can spend in a single credit purchase.

- Enter the maximum purchase amount in your default currency
- Example: $15,000.00 USD maximum purchase

<Note>
  These limits help control credit purchase volumes and prevent potential abuse while providing flexibility for high-volume users.
