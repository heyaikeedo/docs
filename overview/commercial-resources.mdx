Here, you'll find valuable tools and assets exclusively available to our Extended/Commercial License users. These resources are designed to enhance your experience and help you make the most of Aikeedo's powerful AI-driven content creation capabilities.

## Why are these resources exclusive?

These supplementary resources are offered as a complimentary benefit to our Extended/Commercial License holders. Here's why:

2. **Added Value**: While not essential for the core functionality of Aikeedo, these resources provide additional support for business-oriented implementations.

3. **Specialized Use**: The Figma designs and pricing calculator are tailored for users who are looking to customize and monetize their Aikeedo instance.

<Note>
These resources do not affect any functionality within the Aikeedo app itself. They are provided as complementary tools to assist Extended/Commercial License users in maximizing the potential of their Aikeedo implementation.
