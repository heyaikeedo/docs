## Introduction

Text streaming displays AI responses in real-time as they generate, creating a more engaging user experience. This guide covers functionality, compatibility, and troubleshooting.

## How It Works

Aikeedo's text streaming functionality:
- Works out of the box on most web servers
- Supports shared hosting environments
- Requires minimal configuration in most cases

<Note>
  Text streaming is enabled by default and should work immediately after installation. Most users won't need to make any configuration changes.
</Note>

## Server Configuration

While Aikeedo works with default server settings in most cases, some servers might need minor adjustments:

### PHP Settings

If streaming isn't working, check these settings in your `php.ini` file:

```ini
output_buffering = Off
zlib.output_compression = Off
```

<Note>
  These settings prevent PHP from buffering the output, allowing for immediate transmission of text chunks to the client.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If you're using shared hosting and can't modify php.ini, contact your hosting provider. Many providers can adjust these settings for you if needed.
</Tip>

### Web Server Settings

#### For Nginx Servers

Aikeedo automatically sets the required headers for text streaming. However, if your Nginx is configured as a proxy server, you might need these settings:

```nginx
proxy_buffering off;
fastcgi_buffering off;
```
<Tip>
  These settings are typically added in the `nginx.conf` file or within the specific server block for your Aikeedo installation.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Most Nginx installations work without any changes, thanks to the `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header Aikeedo sets for streaming responses.
</Note>

#### For Apache Servers

Apache servers typically work without any changes. If you experience issues, try disabling the gzip module by adding the following to your `/public/.htaccess` file:

```apache
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [NS,E=no-gzip:1,E=dont-vary:1]
</IfModule>
```

## Common Issues

### Buffering Issues

If you experience delayed or chunked responses, or responses appear all at once instead of streaming:

1. Verify all buffering-related settings are properly configured
2. Clear your server's cache
3. Restart your web server after making configuration changes
4. Clear your browser cache
5. Try a different browser
6. Check if your hosting provider is using any aggressive caching

### Caching Mechanisms

Various caching layers can affect text streaming:

- Server-level caching
- PHP opcode caching
- Reverse proxy caching
- Browser caching

<Tip>
  If responses are delayed, try disabling any caching plugins or features your hosting provider might have enabled.
</Tip>

### Known Hosting Limitations

<Warning>
  Some hosting providers may have restrictions that affect text streaming. If you experience issues, contact your hosting provider's support team for assistance.
</Warning>

- **Cloudways**: Text streaming is not supported due to their server stack configuration
- **Shared Hosting**: May have limited configuration options
- **Managed Hosting**: Check with your provider about configuring streaming settings

## Troubleshooting Checklist

Use this checklist to diagnose streaming issues:

- Verify PHP configuration settings
- Check web server buffering settings
- Confirm no interfering caching mechanisms
- Test with different browsers
- Monitor server logs for errors
- Verify hosting provider compatibility
