## Introduction

BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) allows you to let workspace owners use their own OpenAI and Anthropic API keys. This gives workspaces more control over their AI service usage while reducing your central API costs.

## How It Works

When you enable BYOK:
- Workspace owners can add their own API keys in their workspace settings
- Their workspace will use their custom keys instead of your global API keys
- API costs for that workspace will be charged to their own API keys
- Workspaces without custom keys will continue using your global API keys

<Note>
  BYOK helps distribute API costs across workspaces while maintaining central control over feature availability.
</Note>

## Enabling BYOK

1. Go to Settings â†’ Integrations in your admin panel
2. Select either OpenAI or Anthropic
3. Toggle the "Custom API keys (BYOK)" switch to enable
4. Click "Save changes"

<Note>
  You can enable BYOK separately for OpenAI and Anthropic services.
</Note>

## Administrative Benefits

### Cost Management
- Reduce central API costs by letting workspaces use their own keys
- Maintain global API keys as fallback for workspaces without custom keys
- Better cost distribution across high-usage workspaces

### Control
- Enable/disable BYOK at any time
- Choose which AI services support custom keys
- Keep control over feature availability while delegating API costs

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  When disabling BYOK for a service, all workspaces using custom keys will automatically switch to your global API key.
</Warning>

- Workspace owners are responsible for managing their API key validity and costs
- Your global API keys serve as fallback when custom keys are not provided
- Workspace members cannot see the custom API keys set by workspace owners

## Troubleshooting

If workspace owners report issues:

1. Verify BYOK is properly enabled for the relevant service
2. Check if the workspace has entered valid API keys
3. Ensure your global API keys are working as fallback
