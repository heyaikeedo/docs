## Introduction

Localization is a crucial feature that allows you to make Aikeedo accessible to a global audience. This guide will walk you through the process of translating your Aikeedo instance, managing language files, and enabling language selection for your users.

## Translation File Locations

Aikeedo uses separate translation files for different parts of the application:

1. **App and Admin Interface**: `/locale` directory
2. **Landing Page (Home Page)**: `/public/content/plugins/heyaikeedo/default/locale` directory

    This is the default location for the landing page translations. The full path structure follows this pattern:

    `/{webroot}/content/plugins/{organization}/{theme}/locale`

    Where:
    - `{webroot}` is typically `public`, but may be `public_html` in some installations (e.g., cPanel)
    - `{organization}` is usually `heyaikeedo`, but can be customized to your organization name if you're using a custom theme
    - `{theme}` is `default` for the standard theme, but could be different if you're using a custom theme

    <Note>
    Always check your specific installation setup to confirm the exact path.
    </Note>

    <Tip>
    For more information on creating custom themes and managing their translations, refer to our [Theme Development](/development/introduction) guide.
    </Tip>

## Translation Process

To translate Aikeedo into a new language or modify existing translations, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory based on the section you want to translate.
2. Locate the `.po` file for your target language.
3. Open the file in a text editor or a specialized PO file editor.
4. Find the `msgid` entries, which contain the original English text.
5. Enter your translations in the corresponding `msgstr` fields.

<Note>
  Always keep the `msgid` values unchanged. Only modify the `msgstr` entries.
</Note>

### Example Translation

Here's a simple example of how a translation might look in a `.po` file:

```
msgid "Welcome to Aikeedo"
msgstr "Bienvenue sur Aikeedo"
```

## Managing Available Languages

To enable or disable languages for your Aikeedo instance:

1. Open the `/locale/locale.json` file.
2. Modify the JSON structure to add or remove language entries.

<Tip>
  If you're not familiar with JSON, consider using a JSON editor to avoid syntax errors.
</Tip>

## User Language Selection

Aikeedo provides two ways for users to change their preferred language:

### For Logged-in Users

1. Log into the Aikeedo app.
2. Click on your name in the account menu (bottom-left of the app dashboard).
3. Navigate to your profile page.
4. Look for the language selection option and choose your preferred language.

### For Website Visitors

The language selection process for website visitors may vary depending on the theme used. In the default theme:

1. Look for the language switcher in the website header (often in the top-right corner).
2. Click on the switcher (typically represented by a globe icon or current language code).
3. Select your preferred language from the dropdown menu.

<Note>
  The exact location and appearance of the language selector may differ based on your chosen theme. Some themes might place it in a different part of the header, footer, or even in a side menu.
</Note>

## Best Practices for Localization

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology across all translations.
2. **Context**: Consider the context in which the text appears to ensure accurate translations.
3. **Testing**: After translating, thoroughly test the interface in each language to catch any layout or functionality issues.
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep translations up-to-date with each new release of Aikeedo.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with localization:

- Ensure all `.po` files are properly formatted.
- Check that the `locale.json` file is correctly configured.
- Clear your browser cache and application cache after making changes.
- Verify that the correct language files are being loaded in the application settings.
