This guide will walk you through the process of installing Aikeedo on your server.

<Warning>
  **cPanel Users:** If you're using cPanel hosting, you MUST follow our dedicated [cPanel Installation Guide](/setup/installation/cpanel) instead of this guide. The steps are significantly different and this guide will not work for cPanel installations.

## Before You Start

1. Ensure your server meets our [requirements](/overview/server-requirements).
2. Prepare a database and note down its name, username, and password.

## Understanding the Public Directory

It's crucial to understand how Aikeedo's file structure works with your domain:

- Aikeedo has a `public` directory that contains web-accessible files.
- Your domain should point to this `public` directory, not the root of all Aikeedo files.
- The `public` directory cannot be moved; it must remain within the Aikeedo file structure.

Example:
If you extract Aikeedo files to `/var/www/yourdomain.com`, your domain must point to `/var/www/yourdomain.com/public`.

<Tip>
  Consult your hosting provider's documentation on how to set the correct document root for your domain.
</Tip>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Aikeedo Files">
    1. Locate the `aikeedo-server-files.zip` in your Aikeedo package.
    2. Upload this zip file to your server, outside of any existing web-accessible directories.

    <Note>
      If you can't find the zip file, refer to our [File Structure](/overview/file-structure) guide.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract Files">
    Extract the contents of `aikeedo-server-files.zip` so that the `public` folder ends up in your domain's root directory.
 
    Example:
    ```
    /var/www/yourdomain.com/
    ├── bin/
    ├── bootstrap/
    ├── ci/
    ├── config/
    ├── ...
    ├── public/
    └── ... (other Aikeedo directories and files)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Domain">
    Set your domain's document root to point to the `public` directory within the extracted Aikeedo files.

    Example:
    If Aikeedo is extracted to `/var/www/yourdomain.com`, set the document root to `/var/www/yourdomain.com/public`.

    <Tip>
      This step often requires configuration in your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or hosting control panel.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Install Page">
    1. Open your web browser.
    2. Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com`.
    3. You should be automatically redirected to `https://yourdomain.com/install`.
    4. If redirected successfully, you should see the Aikeedo installation wizard.

    <Note>
      If you're not automatically redirected to the install page, it's likely that your domain is not correctly pointing to the `public` directory. In this case, you might see a 403 error. Double-check your domain's document root configuration to ensure it's set to the `public` folder within your Aikeedo installation.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow On-Screen Instructions">
    The installation wizard will guide you through the setup process:
    1. Provide Database Credentials:
       - Enter the database name, username, and password.
    2. Enter your Aikeedo Purchase Code:
       - This is the unique code you received when you purchased Aikeedo.
    3. Set up Admin Account Details:
       - Create your administrator account for managing Aikeedo.
    
    Carefully follow each step of the wizard, ensuring all information is entered accurately. This will ensure a smooth and successful installation of your Aikeedo instance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Once you have provided all the necessary information, the installation wizard will finalize the setup:

    1. The wizard will process your inputs and configure Aikeedo accordingly.
    2. Wait patiently as the system completes the installation process.
    3. Upon completion, you'll see a success message confirming that Aikeedo has been successfully installed.
    4. Verify that you can access the Aikeedo dashboard or main page without any errors.
    5. Confirm that the installation was successful by checking key features or settings.
