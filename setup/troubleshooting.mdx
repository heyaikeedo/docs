## Installation Issues

### Assets Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Installation page appears without styling
- Images, CSS, and JavaScript files fail to load
- Browser shows 404 errors for asset files

**Cause:**
The domain is not correctly pointing to the `public` directory.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Document Root">
  Ensure your domain points to the `public` directory within your Aikeedo installation:
  
  ```
  /path/to/aikeedo/public
  ```
  
  Not to the root Aikeedo directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Redirection">
  Visit your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`). You should be automatically redirected to `https://yourdomain.com/install`.
  
  <Check>
  If the redirect works, your domain is configured correctly.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="cPanel Users">
  If you're using cPanel and cannot change the document root for your main domain, follow the dedicated [cPanel Installation Guide](/setup/installation/cpanel).
  
  <Note>
  The cPanel installation process differs from the standard installation due to control panel limitations.
  </Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

### 404 or 403 Errors During Installation

**Symptoms:**
- 404 error when accessing `/install`
- 403 Forbidden error on home page
- Installation wizard not accessible

**Cause:**
Domain document root not pointing to the `public` directory, missing files, incorrect permissions, or web server configuration issues preventing proper request routing.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Document Root Configuration">
  Ensure your domain's document root points to the `public` folder:
  
  **For cPanel:**
  - Main domain: Points to `public_html` by default (this is correct)
  - Ensure Aikeedo's `public` folder contents are copied to `public_html`
  - Add-on domains/subdomains: Update document root in cPanel to point to the `public` folder
  
  **For VPS/Dedicated:**
  - Set document root to `/path/to/aikeedo/public`
  
  <Tip>
  Accessing your domain should automatically redirect you to `/install` if the document root is correctly configured.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Web Server">
  Configure your web server to serve PHP applications and rewrite all requests to `/public/index.php`:
  
  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Nginx">
    Ensure your server block is configured correctly:
    
    ```nginx /etc/nginx/sites-available/aikeedo
    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
        root /path/to/aikeedo/public;
        
        # Add index.php to the list
        index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
        
        # Increase the maximum upload size
        client_max_body_size 256M;
        
        location / {
            # First attempt to serve request as file, then
            # as directory, then fall back to index.php
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$query_string;
        }
        
        # Pass PHP scripts to FastCGI server
        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            
            # Fix for PHP files downloading instead of execute
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_ROOT $realpath_root;
            
            # With php-fpm (or other unix sockets):
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
            # With php-cgi (or other tcp sockets):
            # fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
            
            fastcgi_connect_timeout 300s;
            fastcgi_send_timeout 300s;
            fastcgi_read_timeout 300s;
        }
        
        # Deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root
        # concurs with nginx's one
        location ~ /\.ht {
            deny all;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    <Note>
    After configuring, test your Nginx configuration: `sudo nginx -t` and reload: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
    
    Adjust the `fastcgi_pass` socket path to match your PHP-FPM configuration. Common locations:
    - `/run/php/php-fpm.sock` (generic)
    - `/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock` (version-specific)
    - `/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock` (alternative path)
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Apache">
    Ensure your virtual host is configured correctly with proper rewrite rules:
    
    ```apache /etc/apache2/sites-available/aikeedo.conf
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName yourdomain.com
        ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
        DocumentRoot /path/to/aikeedo/public
    
        <Directory /path/to/aikeedo/public>
            Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
    
    <Note>
    Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled: `sudo a2enmod rewrite` and reload Apache: `sudo systemctl reload apache2`
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  
  <Warning>
  The server configurations provided above are minimal samples. Consult with your server administrator for the correct configuration for your specific server environment, especially if you're using load balancers, reverse proxies, or have specific security requirements.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify .htaccess File (Apache)">
  If you're using Apache, ensure the `.htaccess` file is present in the `public` directory. Aikeedo includes this file by default with the correct rewrite rules.
  
  <Note>
  Hidden files may not be visible by default. Enable "Show hidden files" in your FTP client or file manager if you need to verify the file exists.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Check File Extraction">
  Verify all Aikeedo files are extracted correctly and the `public` directory exists with all necessary files.
</Step>

<Step title="Set File Permissions">
  Ensure the web server has appropriate permissions:
  
  ```bash
  # Set directory permissions
  find /path/to/aikeedo -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
  
  # Set file permissions
  find /path/to/aikeedo -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Virtual Host Settings">
  Double-check that all virtual host settings are correctly configured:
  
  - **Document Root**: Must point to `/path/to/aikeedo/public` (not the root directory)
  - **Server Name/Alias**: Must match your domain exactly
  - **PHP Handler**: Configured correctly (PHP-FPM for Nginx, mod_php or PHP-FPM for Apache)
  - **Rewrite Rules**: Enabled and properly configured to route all requests to `index.php`
</Step>

<Step title="Test Configuration">
  After making changes:
  
  1. Test web server configuration:
     - Nginx: `sudo nginx -t`
     - Apache: `sudo apache2ctl configtest`
  
  2. Reload your web server:
     ```bash
     # Nginx
     sudo systemctl reload nginx
     
     # Apache
     sudo systemctl reload apache2
     ```
  
  3. Visit your domain - you should be automatically redirected to `/install`
  
  <Check>
  If you're redirected to `/install`, your server configuration is correct.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
All requests must be rewritten to `/public/index.php` for the application to function correctly. Without proper rewrite rules, you'll encounter 404 errors on all routes except the home page.
</Warning>

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot connect to database during installation
- Database error messages in installation wizard
- Installation fails at database configuration step

**Cause:**
Incorrect database credentials, missing database, or insufficient permissions.

**Solution:**

1. **Verify Database Credentials**
   - **Database name**: Must be exact (case-sensitive)
   - **Username**: Database user with proper permissions
   - **Password**: Correct password for the database user
   - **Host**: Usually `localhost`, but may be different on some hosts

2. **Check Database Server**
   - Ensure the database server (MySQL/MariaDB) is running
   - Verify the database is accessible from your web server
   - Confirm the database exists and is empty

3. **Verify User Permissions**
   
   The database user must have these permissions:
   - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
   - CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER
   
   <Tip>
   If unsure, grant ALL PRIVILEGES to the database user for the specific database.
   </Tip>

4. **Check PHP Extensions**
   
   Verify that required PHP database extensions are installed:
   - `mysqli` for MySQL
   - `pdo_mysql` for PDO support
   
   Check with:
   ```bash
   php -m | grep -i mysql
   ```

If problems persist, try creating a new database and user with full permissions.

  ```bash
  php -v
  ```
  
  Verify all required extensions are installed:
  ```bash
  php -m
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Set Correct Ownership and Permissions">
  ```bash
  # Set ownership (replace www-data with your web server user)
  chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/aikeedo
  
  # Set directory permissions
  find /path/to/aikeedo -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
  
  # Set file permissions
  find /path/to/aikeedo -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
  ```
  
  <Note>
  Common web server users: `www-data` (Ubuntu/Debian), `apache` (CentOS/RHEL), `nginx` (Nginx)
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Restart PHP-FPM (if applicable)">
  If using PHP-FPM:
  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm
  ```
  
  Replace `8.2` with your PHP version.
</Step>

<Step title="Increase PHP Memory Limit">

### Save Button Does Nothing

**Symptoms:**
- Clicking "Save changes" or other save buttons in the admin panel has no effect
- No error message appears
- Page appears to be unresponsive after clicking save
- Changes are not saved

**Cause:**
Most commonly a backend PHP error that's preventing the request from completing. Can also be a frontend JavaScript issue.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Browser Console for Frontend Errors">
  Before clicking the save button, check for frontend errors:
  
  1. Open your browser's developer console:
     - **Chrome/Edge**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
     - **Firefox**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac)
     - **Safari**: Enable Developer menu first, then press `Cmd+Option+I`
  
  2. Look for any red error messages in the console
  3. Review error details - they often indicate the specific issue
  
  <Note>
  If you see errors in the console before clicking save, the issue is likely frontend-related. Note the error messages for troubleshooting.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Check Server Error Logs (Apache/Nginx)">
  If no frontend errors are visible, first check server-level error logs, as the issue might occur before the request reaches PHP:
  
  1. **Locate your web server error log**:
     ```bash
     # Apache
     /var/log/apache2/error.log
     # or
     /var/log/httpd/error_log
     
     # Nginx
     /var/log/nginx/error.log
     ```
  
  2. **View recent errors**:
     ```bash
     tail -f /path/to/error.log
     ```
  
  3. **Click the save button** while monitoring the log
  4. **Review any error messages** that appear
  
  <Note>
  Server-level errors can include issues like request timeouts, connection problems, or web server configuration errors that prevent requests from reaching PHP.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Check PHP Error Logs (Backend Issue)">
  If no server-level errors are found, check PHP error logs:
  
  1. **Locate your PHP error log** (common locations):
     ```bash
     # PHP-FPM
     /var/log/php8.2-fpm.log
     # or check php.ini for error_log location
     # You can find it with: php -i | grep error_log
     ```
  
  2. **View recent errors**:
     ```bash
     tail -f /path/to/php-error.log
     ```
  
  3. **Click the save button** while monitoring the log
  4. **Review the error message** that appears in the log
  
  <Tip>
  The error log will show the exact PHP error preventing the save operation from completing. Common issues include database errors, permission problems, or missing dependencies.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Enable DEBUG Mode and Check API Response">
  Alternatively, enable DEBUG mode to get more detailed error information:
  
  1. **Enable DEBUG mode** from the admin panel:
     - Navigate to **Status** page in the admin panel
     - Enable DEBUG mode using the toggle or button provided
  
  2. **Open your browser's developer console** (see step 1 above)
  
  3. **Navigate to the Network tab** in the developer console
  
  4. **Click the save button** again
  
  5. **Look for the API request** that was made when you clicked save (usually shows as a POST request)
  
  6. **Click on the request** to view details:
     - Check the **Status Code** (should be between 200 and 299 for success, 4xx/5xx for errors)
     - Check the **Response** tab to see the response body
     - Review any error messages in the response
  
  <Warning>
  Remember to disable DEBUG mode from the Status page after troubleshooting, as it can expose sensitive information in production environments.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Address the Specific Error">
  Based on the error information you've gathered:
  
  - **Database errors**: Check database connection and permissions
  - **Permission errors**: Verify file/directory permissions (see [500 Internal Server Error](#500-internal-server-error-during-installation))
  - **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all required PHP extensions are installed
  - **Frontend JavaScript errors**: Check for conflicting scripts or browser compatibility issues
  
  <Tip>
  The specific error message will guide you to the exact solution. Common fixes include updating file permissions, fixing database credentials, or installing missing PHP extensions.
  </Tip>
</Step>

## Database Issues

### MySQL Server Has Gone Away

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: "MySQL server has gone away"
- Database connection drops during requests
- Long-running operations fail

**Cause:**
MySQL server timeout or packet size limitations.

**Solution:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Server Timeout Fix">
  **Problem:** MySQL server times out and closes the connection.
  
  **Solution:** Update your `my.cnf` configuration file:
  
  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  wait_timeout = 28800
  ```
  
  This sets the timeout to 8 hours. Adjust as needed for your use case.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Packet Size Fix">
  **Problem:** MySQL receives packets that are too large or incorrect.
  
  **Solution:** Increase the max packet size in `my.cnf`:
  
  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  max_allowed_packet = 128M
  ```
  
  This allows larger data packets to be processed.
</Tab>

<Tab title="InnoDB Log Size">
  **Problem:** InnoDB log file size is insufficient.
  
  **Solution:** Increase the log file size in `my.cnf`:
  
  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  innodb_log_file_size = 128M
  ```
  
  Or larger, depending on your data volume.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
After modifying `my.cnf`, you must restart your MySQL server for changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

or

```bash
sudo service mysql restart
```
</Warning>

**Finding my.cnf:**

Common locations for the MySQL configuration file:
- Linux: `/etc/my.cnf` or `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
- macOS: `/etc/my.cnf`
- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server X.X\my.ini`

<Note>
If you're on shared hosting and don't have access to `my.cnf`, contact your hosting provider to request these changes.
</Note>

### Uploaded Files Return 404 Not Found Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Uploaded files show "not found" or 404 errors
- Generated files (images, videos, audio, documents etc.) are inaccessible
- Files exist in storage but cannot be accessed via URL
- Browser shows 404 when clicking file links

**Cause:**
File grouping enabled on local storage, secure URLs enabled, incorrect document root configuration, or file permission issues.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Disable File Grouping (if using local storage)">
  If you're experiencing file access issues with local storage, try disabling file grouping:
  
  1. Log in to the admin panel
  2. Navigate to **Settings > Storage**
  3. Locate the "File Grouping" option
  4. Change the value to **"None"**
  5. Click "Save changes"
  
  <Note>
  File grouping and secure URLs are optimized for cloud storage (S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.) and may cause compatibility issues on some local storage configurations, particularly on cPanel-based hosting. If files are inaccessible, disabling these options often resolves the issue.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Disable Secure URLs">
  If you're using local storage without special security requirements:
  
  1. In **Settings > Storage**
  2. Locate the "Secure URLs" option
  3. **Turn off** the "Secure URLs" option
  4. Click "Save changes"
  
  <Warning>
  If files were uploaded with Secure URLs enabled, you may need to re-upload them after disabling this option.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Document Root Configuration">
  If your domain's document root is set to `public_html` instead of `public`:
  
  1. Open your `.env` file in the root directory
  2. Find the line with `PUBLIC_DIR` (it may be commented out with `#`)
  3. Ensure it's set correctly:
     ```bash
     PUBLIC_DIR=public_html
     ```
  4. Remove the `#` symbol if present at the beginning
  5. Save the file
  
  <Note>
  This is particularly important for cPanel users where the default document root is `public_html`.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Check File Permissions">
  Ensure the web server has read access to uploaded files:
  
  ```bash
  # Navigate to your Aikeedo directory
  cd /path/to/aikeedo
  
  # Set correct permissions for storage directory
  chmod -R 755 storage/
  
  # Set correct ownership (replace www-data with your web server user)
  chown -R www-data:www-data storage/
  ```
  
  Common web server users:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `www-data`
  - CentOS/RHEL: `apache`
  - Nginx: `nginx`
</Step>

<Step title="Check Cloud Storage CORS Configuration">
  If you're using cloud storage (AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.), CORS issues may prevent file access:
  
  1. **Check your cloud storage CORS configuration:**
     - Ensure your bucket allows requests from your domain
     - Verify that the GET method is allowed (generally sufficient for file access)
     - Check that the correct headers are permitted
  
  2. **Example CORS configuration for AWS S3:**
     ```json
     [
       {
         "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
         "AllowedOrigins": ["https://yourdomain.com", "https://www.yourdomain.com"]
       }
     ]
     ```
  
  3. **Verify your storage configuration:**
     - Check **Settings > Storage** in your admin panel
     - Ensure cloud storage credentials are correct
     - Verify the bucket/container name and region are accurate
  
  <Warning>
  CORS misconfiguration can cause files to appear uploaded but return 404 errors when accessed. Always test file access after making CORS changes.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Storage Path">
  Check that your storage path is correctly configured:
  
  1. Go to **Settings > Storage** in the admin panel
  2. Verify the storage driver is set correctly (Local, S3, etc.)
  3. If using local storage, ensure the path is correct
  4. Test by uploading a new file
  
  <Check>
  If the new file is accessible, the configuration is correct. You may need to re-upload older files.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Clear Application Cache">
  After making configuration changes:
  
  1. Navigate to **Status** page in the admin panel
  2. Click "Clear cache" to clear the application cache
  3. Test file access again
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For production environments requiring secure file access or workspace-based file organization, cloud storage (S3, DigitalOcean Spaces) is recommended. File grouping and secure URL features are optimized for cloud storage and work most reliably in that environment, though they may also work on some local storage configurations.
</Tip>

### Generated Images/Videos Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Generated images or videos fail to display after creation
- Broken image/video placeholders appear instead of content
- 404 or 403 errors when accessing generated media files
- Files appear to generate successfully but cannot be viewed

**Cause:**
Incomplete initial setup, cloud storage CORS misconfiguration, incorrect `.env` file configuration (especially for cPanel installations), or Secure URLs/Group files settings enabled when using local storage.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Initial Setup Completion">
  Ensure you've completed all steps in the [Initial Setup Guide](/setup/initial-setup):
  
  1. Verify your site domain is configured correctly in **Settings > General**
  2. Check that storage settings are properly configured in **Settings > File storage**
  3. Ensure all required integrations are set up if using cloud storage
  
  <Warning>
  Skipping or incorrectly completing initial setup steps can prevent generated files from being accessible.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Check Cloud Storage CORS Configuration">
  If you're using cloud storage (AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, Cloudflare R2, etc.), CORS misconfiguration is a common cause:
  
  1. **Access your cloud storage provider's console** (AWS S3, DigitalOcean, etc.)
  2. **Navigate to your bucket/container settings**
  3. **Review CORS configuration** - it must allow requests from your domain
  4. **Update CORS rules** if needed:
  5. **Save the CORS configuration**
  6. **Test by generating a new image or video**
  
  <Note>
  CORS rules must include your exact domain (with protocol: `https://` or `http://`). Wildcards may not work for all storage providers.
  </Note>
  
  <Tip>
  See the [Cloud Storage Overview](/integrations/cloud-storage/overview) and provider-specific guides for detailed CORS configuration instructions.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Check Secure URLs and Group Files Settings">
  The **Secure URLs** and **Group files** options should only be enabled when using cloud storage (AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.):
  
  1. Navigate to **Settings > File storage** in the admin panel
  2. Review the **Secure URLs** and **Group files** settings
  3. **If using local storage**, ensure both options are disabled:
     - **Secure URLs**: Should be turned **Off**
     - **Group files**: Should be set to **None**
  4. **If using cloud storage**, these options can be enabled as needed
  5. Click "Save changes"
  
  <Warning>
  **Secure URLs** and **Group files** are designed for cloud storage only. Enabling these options with local storage can cause generated files to be inaccessible.
  </Warning>
  
  <Note>
  Changing these settings only affects newly generated files. Files that were already generated with the previous settings will remain unchanged. If the issue stems from Secure URLs, previously generated files can be made accessible by fixing file permissions (see the "Verify Storage Path and Permissions" step below). Otherwise, you may need to regenerate images or videos after adjusting these settings.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify .env File Configuration (cPanel Users)">
  If you're using cPanel, the `.env` file configuration is critical:
  
  1. **Locate your `.env` file** in the Aikeedo root directory (not in `public_html`)
  2. **Find the `PUBLIC_DIR` setting** - it may be commented out with `#`
  3. **For main domain installations**, ensure it's set correctly:
     ```env
     PUBLIC_DIR=public_html
     ```
  4. **Remove the `#` symbol** if the line is commented out
  5. **Save the file**
  
  <Warning>
  If you're using cPanel and the `PUBLIC_DIR` setting is missing or incorrect, generated files will not be accessible. This is a critical step that must be completed during installation.
  </Warning>
  
  <Note>
  For add-on domains or subdomains in cPanel where the document root points directly to the `public` folder, you may not need to set `PUBLIC_DIR` or it should be set to `public`. Refer to the [cPanel Installation Guide](/setup/installation/cpanel) for your specific setup.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Storage Path and Permissions">
  Check that your storage configuration is correct:
  
  1. Navigate to **Settings > File storage** in the admin panel
  2. Verify the storage driver is set correctly (Local, S3, etc.)
  3. If using local storage, ensure the storage path is writable:
     ```bash
     # Check storage directory permissions
     ls -la /path/to/aikeedo/public/uploads/
     
     # Set correct permissions if needed
     chmod -R 755 /path/to/aikeedo/public/uploads/
     chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/aikeedo/public/uploads/
     ```
  4. If using cloud storage, verify:
     - Bucket/container name is correct
     - Region is correctly configured
     - Access keys are valid and have proper permissions
     - Bucket/container exists and is accessible
  
  <Check>
  Test by generating a new image or video. If it loads correctly, the configuration is working.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**For cPanel users:** If you skipped or incorrectly completed the `.env` file configuration step during installation (specifically the `PUBLIC_DIR=public_html` setting), generated files will not load correctly. This is one of the most common causes of this issue on cPanel hosting. Refer to the [cPanel Installation Guide](/setup/installation/cpanel) and ensure you've completed the "Update the Environment File" step correctly.
</Warning>
