description: A quick look at Aikeedo's REST APIs for users and administrators
---

Aikeedo provides two REST APIs to interact with the platform programmatically:

1. **User API**: For end-users and client applications
2. **Admin API**: For system administrators and advanced integrations

## Enabling the APIs

Both APIs can be easily toggled on or off from the admin panel:

1. Go to **Settings > Features > API** in your Aikeedo admin dashboard
2. Use the switches to enable or disable each API as needed

<Note>
  API changes take effect immediately without requiring a system restart.
</Note>

## Accessing API Documentation

Once enabled, you can find the auto-generated API documentation at:

- User API: `https://yourdomain.com/app/api-docs`
- Admin API: `https://yourdomain.com/admin/api-docs`

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your Aikeedo instance domain.
