# Understanding Aikeedo Plugins

Plugins are powerful tools that allow you to extend and customize the functionality of your Aikeedo platform. By leveraging plugins, you can tailor your platform to meet specific requirements and provide an enhanced user experience.

<Note>
This guide reflects the Aikeedo v3.x structure. Plugins and themes are now located in `/extra/extensions/` with assets in `/public/e/`.
</Note>

## What are Aikeedo Plugins?

Aikeedo plugins are specialized Composer packages designed to integrate seamlessly with your platform. They offer a wide range of capabilities, including:

- Adding new features and functionality
- Modifying existing functionality
- Integrating with third-party services
- Adding payment gateways, currency providers, and more

## Directory Structure

In Aikeedo v3.x, plugins and themes use a standardized directory structure:

- **Plugin/Theme files**: `/extra/extensions/yourorganization/name/`
- **Public assets**: `/public/e/yourorganization/name/` (CSS, JS, images)

## Plugins vs. Themes

While both extend Aikeedo's capabilities, they serve different purposes:

### Plugins

Plugins enhance functionality throughout your platform:

- Add new features to the application
- Integrate with third-party services (payment gateways, AI providers, etc.)
- Extend existing functionality
- Modify backend and admin functionality

**Example plugins:**
- Currency rate providers (CurrencyAPI, Currency Beacon)
- Payment gateways
- Analytics integrations
- Custom AI model providers

### Themes

Themes customize the visual appearance of your landing page:

- Modify landing page layout and design
- Customize colors, fonts, and styling
- Create unique user experiences
- Do not affect the app or admin dashboard appearance

**Key differences:**

| Aspect | Plugin | Theme |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Type in composer.json | `aikeedo-plugin` | `aikeedo-theme` |
| Purpose | Functionality | Visual design |
| Affects | Entire platform | Landing page only |
| Requires assets | Optional | Usually yes |

<Info>
Both plugins and themes are installed in `/extra/extensions/` and follow the same Composer package structure.
</Info>

## Installing Plugins and Themes

You have multiple options for installing plugins and themes on your Aikeedo platform:

### 1. Via Composer (Recommended)

For published packages on Packagist or private repositories:

```bash
composer require vendor/package-name
```

### 2. Local Development

For custom or in-development plugins:

1. Place your plugin/theme in `/extra/extensions/yourorganization/name/`
2. Add to your root `composer.json`:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "./extra/extensions/yourorganization/name"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Install with Composer:

```bash
composer require yourorganization/name
```

### 3. Aikeedo Dashboard

Use the web interface to:
- Browse available plugins and themes
- Install with one click
- Manage installed extensions

## Managing Plugins

Once installed, you can easily manage your plugins directly from the Aikeedo dashboard:

- Enable or disable plugins
- Configure plugin settings
- Update plugins to their latest versions

<Tip>
  Regularly check for plugin updates to ensure you have the latest features and security improvements.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Using Plugins

To get the most out of Aikeedo plugins, consider the following best practices:

1. **Research before installing**: Ensure the plugin is compatible with your version of Aikeedo and meets your specific needs.
2. **Test in a staging environment**: Before applying plugins to your live site, test them in a controlled environment to avoid potential conflicts.
3. **Keep plugins updated**: Regularly update your plugins to benefit from new features and security patches.
4. **Monitor performance**: Keep an eye on your platform's performance after installing new plugins to ensure they don't negatively impact speed or functionality.
