# Understanding Aikeedo Plugins

Plugins are powerful tools that allow you to extend and customize the functionality of your Aikeedo platform. By leveraging plugins, you can tailor your platform to meet specific requirements and provide an enhanced user experience.

## What are Aikeedo Plugins?

Aikeedo plugins are specialized Composer packages designed to integrate seamlessly with your platform. They offer a wide range of capabilities, including:

- Adding new features
- Modifying existing functionality
- Integrating with third-party services

<Note>
  Aikeedo plugins are installed in the `/public/content/plugins` directory of your platform.
</Note>

## Plugins vs. Themes

While plugins focus on enhancing functionality across your entire Aikeedo platform, themes are a special type of plugin that specifically deal with customizing your landing page:

- **Plugins**: 
  - Enhance functionality throughout your platform
  - Modify or add features to the app and admin dashboard
  - Integrate external services

- **Themes**: 
  - Customize the look and feel of your landing page
  - Create custom landing page layouts and designs
  - Do not affect the app or admin dashboard appearance

<Info>
  Both plugins and themes are installed in the `/public/content/plugins` directory, as themes are considered a specialized type of plugin.

## Installing Plugins and Themes

You have two convenient options for installing plugins and themes on your Aikeedo platform:

1. **Aikeedo Dashboard**: Use the intuitive web interface to browse, install, and manage plugins and themes.
2. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: For users comfortable with command-line operations, the CLI offers a quick way to install and manage plugins.

## Managing Plugins

Once installed, you can easily manage your plugins directly from the Aikeedo dashboard:

- Enable or disable plugins
- Configure plugin settings
- Update plugins to their latest versions

<Tip>
  Regularly check for plugin updates to ensure you have the latest features and security improvements.

1. **Research before installing**: Ensure the plugin is compatible with your version of Aikeedo and meets your specific needs.
