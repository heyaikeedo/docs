title: Building Plugins for Aikeedo
description: Learn how to create custom plugins to extend Aikeedo's functionality and tailor your platform to your specific needs.
---

Plugins are powerful tools that allow you to enhance and customize your Aikeedo platform. This guide will walk you through the process of building a plugin, using a simple Currency Beacon integration as an example.

## What are Aikeedo Plugins?

Aikeedo plugins are Composer packages that extend the functionality of your platform. They allow you to:

- Add new features
- Integrate with third-party services
- Customize existing functionality

<Note>
Plugins give you the flexibility to tailor Aikeedo to your specific requirements without modifying the core codebase.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Basic knowledge of PHP and Composer
- A local development environment set up for Aikeedo
- Composer installed on your system

If you need help setting up your local environment, refer to our [Local Development Guide](/development/local-development-guide).

## Step-by-Step Plugin Creation

Let's create a plugin that integrates [CurrencyBeacon](https://currencybeacon.com) as an alternative currency rate provider for your Aikeedo platform.

### Step 1: Create the Plugin Directory

First, create a new directory for your plugin in the `/public/content/plugins` folder of your Aikeedo installation:

```bash
mkdir -p public/content/plugins/heyaikeedo/currency-beacon
```

<Tip>
The directory structure should follow the format: `yourorganization/plugin-name`. This naming convention helps identify and organize plugins.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Create the composer.json File

Every Aikeedo plugin requires a `composer.json` file. This file contains essential metadata about your plugin.

Create a `composer.json` file in your plugin directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "heyaikeedo/currency-beacon",
  "type": "aikeedo-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "require": {
    "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "extra": {
    "entry-class": "Aikeedo\\CurrencyBeacon\\Plugin"
  },
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "Aikeedo\\CurrencyBeacon\\": "src/"
    }
  }
}
```

Let's break down the important parts of this file:

- `name`: Must match the path to your plugin directory (`yourorganization/plugin-name`)
- `type`: Always set to `aikeedo-plugin` for Aikeedo plugins
- `version`: Defines the current version of your plugin
- `require`: Lists the dependencies, including the required `heyaikeedo/composer` package
- `extra.entry-class`: Specifies the main class of your plugin
- `autoload`: Sets up PSR-4 autoloading for your plugin's classes

<Note>
The `heyaikeedo/composer` package is required for all Aikeedo plugins. It provides essential functionality for plugin integration.
</Note>

### Step 3: Create the Plugin Class

Now, let's create the main plugin class. This class will be responsible for initializing your plugin's functionality.

Create a file named `Plugin.php` in the `src` directory of your plugin:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Aikeedo\CurrencyBeacon;

use Override;
use Plugin\Domain\Context;
use Plugin\Domain\PluginInterface;

class Plugin implements PluginInterface
{
    #[Override]
    public function boot(Context $context): void
    {
        // Plugin initialization code goes here
        // For a complete implementation example, visit:
        // https://github.com/heyaikeedo/plugins-currency-beacon
    }
}
```

This class implements the `PluginInterface`, which requires a `boot` method. The `boot` method is called when your plugin is loaded by Aikeedo, allowing you to set up any necessary functionality.

### Step 4: Install the Plugin

With your plugin structure in place, you can now install it using Composer. Run the following command in the root directory of your Aikeedo installation:

```bash
composer require heyaikeedo/currency-beacon
```

This command installs your plugin and its dependencies.

### Step 5: Enable the Plugin

After installation, you'll need to enable your plugin through the Aikeedo dashboard. Look for the "Plugins" section in your admin panel to activate your new plugin.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. **Version Control**: Use Git or another version control system to track changes to your plugin.

2. **Updates**: Regularly update your plugin to maintain compatibility with the latest Aikeedo version.

## Example Implementation

For a complete, working example of an Aikeedo plugin, check out the [Currency Beacon Plugin Repository](https://github.com/heyaikeedo/plugins-currency-beacon) on GitHub.
