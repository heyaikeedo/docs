# Theme Objects Reference

This comprehensive guide covers all theme objects, variables, and data structures available in Aikeedo themes. Each object provides specific functionality and data access for building dynamic theme components.

## Global Objects and Variables

These objects and variables are available globally throughout all theme templates:

- `version` - App version information
- `theme` - Current theme name
- `environment` - Current environment
- `nav` - Navigation registry
- `view_namespace` - Current view namespace
- `config` - All configuration settings
- `currency` - Global currency information
- `locales` - Available locales array
- `locale` - Current locale object
- `option` - All option settings

## User-Specific Objects

These objects are only available when a user is logged in:

- `user` - Current user object with workspace information
- `workspace` - Current user's workspace object

## Nested Objects

These objects are available as properties of other objects:

- `address` - Available as `workspace.address`
- `affiliate` - Available as `user.affiliate`
- `country` - Available as `user.country`
- `subscription` - Available as `workspace.subscription`
- `plan_snapshot` - Available as `subscription.plan`

## User Object

The `user` object is a fundamental component in Aikeedo themes, providing access to essential user information when a user is logged into their account. This object is globally accessible, allowing you to easily incorporate user-specific data and functionality into your theme.

The `user` object is available globally when a user is logged in. If no user is logged in, the object will be undefined. Always check for the existence of the `user` object before attempting to access its properties.

<Note>
  It's a good practice to use conditional checks when working with the `user` object to ensure your theme functions correctly for both logged-in and guest users.

## User Object

The `user` object is a fundamental component in Aikeedo themes, providing access to essential user information when a user is logged into their account. This object is globally accessible, allowing you to easily incorporate user-specific data and functionality into your theme.

The `user` object is available globally when a user is logged in. If no user is logged in, the object will be undefined. Always check for the existence of the `user` object before attempting to access its properties.

<Note>
  It's a good practice to use conditional checks when working with the `user` object to ensure your theme functions correctly for both logged-in and guest users.
