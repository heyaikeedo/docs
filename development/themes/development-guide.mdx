## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of PHP and Composer. You should also have a local development environment set up for Aikeedo.

## Step 1: Create a new theme

To create a new theme, you need to create a new directory in the `/public/content/plugins` directory of your Aikeedo platform with the following structure: `yourorganization/theme-name`. We will name our theme `heyaikeedo/orbit`.

```bash
mkdir -p public/content/plugins/heyaikeedo/orbit
```

## Step 2: Create the composer.json file for the plugin

<Note>
Each theme in Aikeedo is a Composer package thus it requires a `composer.json` file. The `composer.json` file contains metadata about the theme, such as its name, description, and dependencies.
</Note>

Next, create a `composer.json` file in the `public/content/plugins/heyaikeedo/orbit` directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "heyaikeedo/orbit",
  "type": "aikeedo-theme",
  "require": {
    "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

This is minimal `composer.json` file required for an Aikeedo plugin. It specifies the name of the plugin, its type, and the required `heyaikeedo/composer` package. The `heyaikeedo/composer` package is a special Composer package that provides additional functionality for Aikeedo plugins and it must be required by all Aikeedo plugins.

Pay attention to the `type` field in the `composer.json` file. The `type` field must be set to `aikeedo-theme` for Aikeedo themes.

Name of the theme in the `composer.json` file must match the path to the theme directory in the `/public/content/themes` directory. Its format is `yourorganization/theme-name`. Its required to uniquely identify the theme. In our case, the name of the theme is `heyaikeedo/orbit` and the path to the theme directory is `public/content/themes/heyaikeedo/orbit`.

## Step 3: Define version constraints

Only stable packages are allowed to be installed in Aikeedo by default. So we need to define the version constraints for our plugin in the `composer.json` file. We can do this by adding the `version` field to the `composer.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "heyaikeedo/orbit",
  "type": "aikeedo-theme",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "require": {
    "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Our plugin can now be installed as a Composer package using the `composer require` command. However, it won't do anything yet because we haven't created the plugin class yet. Also, the app will throw an error as it won't be able to find the plugin class.

Add addtional metadata to the `composer.json` file.

```json
{
    "name": "heyaikeedo/default",
    "description": "Default theme for Aikeedo",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "aikeedo-theme",
    "homepage": "https://aikeedo.com",
    "time": "2024-03-21",
    "license": "AIKEEDO",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Aikeedo",
            "email": "hey@aikeedo.com",
            "homepage": "https://aikeedo.com",
            "role": "Owner"
        }
    ],
    "support": {
        "chat": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "docs": "https://docs.aikeedo.com/",
        "email": "support@aikeedo.com",
        "forum": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "issues": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "rss": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "source": "https://github.com/heyaikeedo",
        "wiki": "https://docs.aikeedo.com/"
    },
    "require": {
        "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "extra": {
        "title": "Default",
        "description": "Default theme for Aikeedo",
        "logo": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "icon": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "status": "active"
    },
    "autoload": {}
}
```

## Step 4

Create the `templates/index.twig` file in the `public/content/themes/heyaikeedo/orbit` directory with the following content:

App uses TWIG templating engine to render the pages. 

Templates uses the `@theme` twig namespace to load the theme assets.

## Step 4: Create the theme class

Access the Themes page in the admin UI and locate your new theme. Activate it.

Now you can start developing your theme. Its up to you 

Frontend tooling is totally up to you. We recommend using Vite for the frontend tooling.

Several object available to use in themes. Refer to objects section to get details. 

Its highly recommended to use have a look at the [Default theme](https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-default/) to get familiar with the theme development.
