# Building Themes for Aikeedo v3.x

Creating a custom theme for Aikeedo allows you to personalize the look and feel of your platform. This guide covers the modern approach using the **Aikeedo Theme Starter Kit** - a comprehensive development environment that streamlines theme creation.

<Note>
This guide is for Aikeedo v3.x. We strongly recommend using the [themes-starter kit](https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-starter) for new theme development as it provides a modern build system and best practices.

## Option 1: Building a New Theme

### Clone the Starter Repository

Start by cloning the themes-starter repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-starter.git my-theme
cd my-theme
```

### Configure Your Theme Package

Edit `/static/composer.json` with your theme details:

```json
{
  "name": "your-vendor/your-theme-name",
  "description": "Your theme description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "aikeedo-theme",
  "homepage": "https://your-site.com",
  "license": "AIKEEDO",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "Your Name",
      "email": "your.email@example.com",
      "homepage": "https://your-site.com",
      "role": "Developer"
    }
  ],
  "support": {
    "email": "support@your-site.com",
    "docs": "https://docs.your-site.com/"
  },
  "require": {
    "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "extra": {
    "entry-class": "YourVendor\\ThemeName\\Theme",
    "title": "Your Theme Title",
    "description": "Your theme description",
    "logo": "https://your-site.com/logo.png",
    "icon": "https://your-site.com/icon.png",
    "status": "active",
    "public": [
      "assets",
      ".vite"
    ]
  },
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "YourVendor\\ThemeName\\": "src/"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
**Important**: Replace `YourVendor\\ThemeName` with your actual namespace. The namespace in `autoload.psr-4` must match your `entry-class` namespace.
</Warning>

### Set Up Environment

Create your local environment file:

```bash
cp .env .env.local
```

Configure `.env.local` with your paths:

```bash
# Windows path example:
BUILD_DIR=C:/xampp/htdocs/aikeedo/extra/extensions/your-vendor/your-theme-name

# Linux/Mac path example:
BUILD_DIR=/var/www/aikeedo/extra/extensions/your-vendor/your-theme-name

# Aikeedo server URL (required for development)
AIKEEDO_SERVER=http://localhost:8000
```

<Warning>
**Critical**: The final path segments (`your-vendor/your-theme-name`) MUST match your composer.json package name!
</Warning>

### Install Dependencies

Install npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Verify installation:

```bash
# Should list alpinejs and other dependencies
npm list
```

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Start Vite dev server on port 5174
- Watch for file changes
- Copy static files to `BUILD_DIR`
- Extract translations automatically

### Register Theme with Aikeedo

In your Aikeedo installation directory:

```bash
# Add your theme as a requirement
composer require your-vendor/your-theme-name
```

### Configure Aikeedo

Add or update these settings in your Aikeedo's `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for development
THEME_ASSETS_SERVER=http://localhost:5174/

# Set environment to development
ENVIRONMENT=dev

# Enable debug mode for development
DEBUG=1

# Disable caching for development
CACHE=0
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Your theme should be here
ls /path/to/aikeedo/public/content/plugins/your-vendor/your-theme-name
```

### Activate Your Theme

<Steps>
<Step title="Log into Admin Panel">
  Access your Aikeedo admin panel
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Themes">
  Go to the Themes section in the admin panel
</Step>

<Step title="Find Your Theme">
  Locate your theme in the list of available themes
</Step>

<Step title="Activate Theme">
  Click "Publish" to activate your theme
  
  <Check>
  Your theme is now active and visible to users!
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2: Customizing the Default Theme

For simple modifications to the default theme, you can make direct changes without rebuilding from source.

<Note>
This approach is suitable for basic customizations. For complex changes, consider rebuilding from source (Option 4).

## Option 4: Rebuilding Themes from Source

For complex customizations, rebuild the theme from source using the same process as building a new theme.

### Rebuilding the Default Theme

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Default Theme Repository">
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-default.git my-custom-theme
  cd my-custom-theme
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your Theme">
  Follow the same configuration steps as building a new theme, but update the package name to avoid conflicts:
  
  ```json
  {
    "name": "yourorganization/custom-default",
    "description": "Customized default theme",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "aikeedo-theme",
    "require": {
      "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "extra": {
      "title": "Custom Default Theme",
      "status": "active"
    }
  }
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Development Environment">
  Follow the same environment setup as building a new theme, but point to your custom theme directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Make Your Customizations">
  Edit the source files in the `src/` and `static/` directories as needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Build and Deploy">
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run pack
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

<mode-switcher>
  <button class="text-2xl">
    <i class="ti ti-moon-stars dark:hidden"></i>
    <i class="hidden ti ti-sun-filled dark:block"></i>
  </button>
</mode-switcher>

<!-- Avatar Component -->
<x-avatar title="User Name" src="/path/to/avatar.jpg" length="2"></x-avatar>
```

### Twig Templates

Use the modern Twig templating system:

```twig
{% extends "@theme/layouts/theme.twig" %}

{% block template %}
  <div class="container">
    {% include "@theme/sections/header.twig" %}
    {{ content }}
  </div>
{% endblock %}
```

### Internationalization

The starter kit includes automatic translation extraction:

- **Automatic string extraction** to PO files
- **Multiple language support** with Gettext
- **Translation file watching** during development
- **Uses PHP's Gettext** for translations

### Available Commands

| Command         | Purpose                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Start Vite development server    |
| `npm run build` | Build production assets          |
| `npm run serve` | Preview production build         |
| `npm run locale`| Extract translatable strings     |
| `npm run pack`  | Create installable theme package |
| `npm run release`| Create distribution package      |

### Theme Objects

Aikeedo provides several objects for use in Twig templates:

- **theme**: Theme metadata and configuration
- **option**: Site settings and options
- **user**: Current user information
- **environment**: Environment variables and settings

Refer to the [Theme Objects](/development/themes/objects) documentation for complete details.

## Best Practices

1. **Use the Starter Kit**: Always start with the [themes-starter](https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-starter) for new themes
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your theme looks good on all device sizes using Tailwind CSS
3. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines to make your theme usable for everyone
4. **Performance**: 
   - Leverage Vite's built-in optimization
   - Use Tailwind's utility classes for efficient CSS
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Take advantage of Alpine.js's lightweight nature
5. **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes and maintain version history
6. **Documentation**: Document your theme's features and customization options
7. **Testing**: Test across different browsers and devices

## Common Setup Issues

### Assets Not Loading

If theme assets aren't loading:

- Verify `THEME_ASSETS_SERVER` in Aikeedo's `.env`
- Ensure Vite server is running on port 5174
- Check proxy settings in `vite.config.mjs`

### Template Changes Not Reflecting

1. Clear Aikeedo's cache
2. Check `BUILD_DIR` path is correct
3. Verify file permissions

### Build Problems

- Verify all paths in `.env.local`
- Check write permissions on `BUILD_DIR`
- Review Vite build output for errors
