# Building Themes for Aikeedo v3.x

Creating a custom theme for Aikeedo allows you to personalize the look and feel of your platform. This guide covers the v3.x structure for building themes from scratch.

<Note>
This guide is for Aikeedo v3.x. The theme structure has been updated from v2.x. Themes are now located in `/extra/extensions/` with assets in `/public/e/`.
</Note>

## Understanding Theme Structure

In Aikeedo v3.x, themes consist of two main directories:

1. **Theme files**: `/extra/extensions/yourorganization/theme-name/` - Contains templates, configuration, and localization
2. **Asset files**: `/public/e/yourorganization/theme-name/` - Contains CSS, JavaScript, images, and other public assets

## Getting Started

### 1. Create the Theme Directories

Create both the theme and asset directories for your theme. We'll create a theme called "Orbit":

```bash
# Create theme directory
mkdir -p extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/orbit

# Create assets directory
mkdir -p public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit
```

<Tip>
The directory structure should follow the format: `yourorganization/theme-name`. Use consistent naming across both directories.
</Tip>

### 2. Set Up the Composer Package

Aikeedo themes are Composer packages that require a `composer.json` file for metadata and dependencies.

Create a `composer.json` file in your theme directory (`/extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/orbit/composer.json`). Here's a minimal version that's sufficient for a functional theme:

```json
{
    "name": "heyaikeedo/orbit",
    "type": "aikeedo-theme",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "require": {
        "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "extra": {
        "title": "Orbit",
        "status": "active"
    }
}
````

This minimal version includes the essential fields needed for your theme to function properly.

<Note>
  The `type` attribute must be set to `aikeedo-theme`. This is crucial for Aikeedo to recognize and properly handle your package as a theme.
</Note>

For a more comprehensive `composer.json` file, you can use the following extended version:

```json
{
    "name": "heyaikeedo/orbit",
    "description": "Orbit theme for Aikeedo",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "aikeedo-theme",
    "homepage": "https://aikeedo.com",
    "time": "2024-03-21",
    "license": "AIKEEDO",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Aikeedo",
            "email": "hey@aikeedo.com",
            "homepage": "https://aikeedo.com",
            "role": "Owner"
        }
    ],
    "support": {
        "chat": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "docs": "https://docs.aikeedo.com/",
        "email": "support@aikeedo.com",
        "forum": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "issues": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "rss": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "source": "https://github.com/heyaikeedo",
        "wiki": "https://docs.aikeedo.com/"
    },
    "require": {
        "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "extra": {
        "title": "Orbit",
        "description": "Orbit theme for Aikeedo",
        "logo": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "icon": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "status": "active"
    },
    "autoload": {}
}
````

This extended version provides more detailed information about your theme, including author details, support links, and additional metadata.

<Note>
  The `name` field in `composer.json` must match the path to your theme directory (e.g., `heyaikeedo/orbit`). This uniquely identifies your theme.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Start with the minimal version and expand your `composer.json` file as your theme grows and requires more detailed information. Remember to always keep the `type` set to `aikeedo-theme`.
</Tip>

### 3. Create the Template Structure

Aikeedo uses the Twig templating engine to render pages. Create the templates directory and main template:

```bash
mkdir -p extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/orbit/templates
```

Create a `templates/index.twig` file in your theme directory with a basic HTML structure:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Orbit Theme</title>
  
  {# Load CSS from assets directory #}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to Orbit</h1>
  <p>This is the Orbit theme for Aikeedo.</p>
  
  {# Load JavaScript from assets directory #}
  <script src="/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/js/app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

<Tip>
Assets are served from `/e/yourorganization/theme-name/` path. Reference them using absolute paths starting with `/e/`.
</Tip>

### 4. Create Asset Files

Create your CSS, JavaScript, and other assets in the public assets directory:

```bash
# Create asset subdirectories
mkdir -p public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/css
mkdir -p public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/js
mkdir -p public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/assets
```

Create a basic stylesheet (`public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/css/styles.css`):

```css
body {
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
}
```

Create a basic JavaScript file (`public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/js/app.js`):

```javascript
console.log('Orbit theme loaded');
```

### 5. Set Up Localization (Optional)

Create a locale directory for multilingual support:

```bash
mkdir -p extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/orbit/locale
```

Add translation files following the same structure as the default theme. See [Localization](/advanced/localization) for more details.

## Directory Structure Summary

Your complete theme structure should look like this:

```
extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/orbit/
├── composer.json
├── templates/
│   └── index.twig
└── locale/
    └── en-US.po (optional)

public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit/
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── app.js
└── assets/
    └── (images, fonts, etc.)
```

## Activating Your Theme

<Steps>
<Step title="Install via Composer">
  If your theme is a Composer package, install it:
  
  ```bash
  composer require heyaikeedo/orbit
  ```
  
  <Note>
  For local development, you can manually place files in the directories and skip Composer installation.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Enable in Admin Panel">
  1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel
  2. Navigate to the **Themes** page
  3. Locate your new theme (Orbit)
  4. Click the "Activate" button to enable your theme
  
  <Check>
  Your theme is now active and visible to users!
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Further Development

Now that you have the basic structure in place, you can start customizing your theme:

### Frontend Build Tools

Choose a frontend build tool that suits your workflow:

- **Vite** (recommended): Fast, modern build tool with HMR
- **Webpack**: More established, highly configurable
- **Parcel**: Zero-configuration bundler

Example Vite setup:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default {
  build: {
    outDir: '../../public/e/heyaikeedo/orbit',
    emptyOutDir: true
  }
}
```

### Theme Objects

Aikeedo provides several objects for use in Twig templates:

- **theme**: Theme metadata and configuration
- **option**: Site settings and options
- **user**: Current user information
- **environment**: Environment variables and settings

Refer to the [Theme Objects](/development/themes/objects/address) documentation for complete details.

### Study the Default Theme

For inspiration and best practices, examine the [Default Aikeedo theme](https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-default/):

- Modern build setup with Vite
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility best practices

## Best Practices

1. **Separate Concerns**: Keep theme files in `/extra/extensions/` and assets in `/public/e/`
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your theme looks good on all device sizes
3. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines to make your theme usable for everyone
4. **Performance**: 
   - Minify CSS and JavaScript
   - Optimize images
   - Use lazy loading for images
   - Implement asset caching
5. **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes and maintain version history
6. **Documentation**: Document your theme's features and customization options
7. **Testing**: Test across different browsers and devices

## Protecting Customizations from Updates

<Warning>
Changes to the default theme will be overwritten during app updates. Always create a custom theme for modifications.
</Warning>

To protect your customizations:

1. **Duplicate the Default Theme**: Copy the entire theme structure
2. **Rename Your Theme**: Update `composer.json` with your organization name
3. **Copy Assets**: Duplicate assets to your new theme's `/public/e/` directory
4. **Activate Custom Theme**: Enable your custom theme in the admin panel

See the [Landing Page Customization](/website-basics/landing-page) guide for detailed duplication steps.

## Troubleshooting

### Theme Not Appearing in Admin Panel

- Verify `composer.json` has `"type": "aikeedo-theme"`
- Ensure the `name` field matches your directory path
- Check file permissions on the theme directory
- Run `composer dump-autoload` to refresh Composer's autoloader

### Assets Not Loading

- Verify assets are in `/public/e/yourorganization/theme-name/`
- Check that asset paths start with `/e/` in templates
- Clear browser cache and application cache
- Verify web server has read permissions on asset files

### Styles Not Applying

- Check browser console for 404 errors on CSS files
- Verify CSS file paths are correct
- Ensure CSS is loaded in the `<head>` section
- Clear any CDN or proxy caches
