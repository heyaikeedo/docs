# Building Themes for Aikeedo

Creating a custom theme for Aikeedo allows you to personalize the look and feel of your platform. This guide will walk you through the process of building a theme, from setting up the directory structure to activating your new theme.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create the Theme Directory

First, create a new directory for your theme in the `/public/content/plugins` directory of your Aikeedo platform. Use the following structure: `yourorganization/theme-name`.

For this guide, we'll create a theme called "Orbit":

```bash
mkdir -p public/content/plugins/heyaikeedo/orbit
```

### 2. Set Up the Composer Package

Aikeedo themes are Composer packages, which require a `composer.json` file for metadata and dependencies.

Create a `composer.json` file in your theme directory. Here's a minimal version that's sufficient for a functional theme:

```json
{
    "name": "heyaikeedo/orbit",
    "type": "aikeedo-theme",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "require": {
        "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "extra": {
        "title": "Orbit",
        "status": "active"
    }
}
````

This minimal version includes the essential fields needed for your theme to function properly.

<Note>
  The `type` attribute must be set to `aikeedo-theme`. This is crucial for Aikeedo to recognize and properly handle your package as a theme.
</Note>

For a more comprehensive `composer.json` file, you can use the following extended version:

```json
{
    "name": "heyaikeedo/orbit",
    "description": "Orbit theme for Aikeedo",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "aikeedo-theme",
    "homepage": "https://aikeedo.com",
    "time": "2024-03-21",
    "license": "AIKEEDO",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Aikeedo",
            "email": "hey@aikeedo.com",
            "homepage": "https://aikeedo.com",
            "role": "Owner"
        }
    ],
    "support": {
        "chat": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "docs": "https://docs.aikeedo.com/",
        "email": "support@aikeedo.com",
        "forum": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "issues": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "rss": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "source": "https://github.com/heyaikeedo",
        "wiki": "https://docs.aikeedo.com/"
    },
    "require": {
        "heyaikeedo/composer": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "extra": {
        "title": "Orbit",
        "description": "Orbit theme for Aikeedo",
        "logo": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "icon": "https://aikeedo.com/",
        "status": "active"
    },
    "autoload": {}
}
````

This extended version provides more detailed information about your theme, including author details, support links, and additional metadata.

<Note>
  The `name` field in `composer.json` must match the path to your theme directory (e.g., `heyaikeedo/orbit`). This uniquely identifies your theme.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Start with the minimal version and expand your `composer.json` file as your theme grows and requires more detailed information. Remember to always keep the `type` set to `aikeedo-theme`.
</Tip>

### 3. Create the Main Template

Aikeedo uses the Twig templating engine to render pages. Create a `templates/index.twig` file in your theme directory with a basic HTML structure:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Orbit</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Orbit Theme</h1>
  <p>This is the Orbit theme for Aikeedo.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

<Tip>
  Use the `@theme` Twig namespace to load theme assets in your templates.
</Tip>

## Activating Your Theme

1. Access the Themes page in the Aikeedo admin UI.
2. Locate your new theme (Orbit).
3. Click the "Activate" button to enable your theme.

## Further Development

Now that you have the basic structure in place, you can start customizing your theme. Here are some tips for further development:

- **Frontend Tooling**: Choose a frontend build tool that suits your workflow. We recommend using Vite for its speed and ease of use.
- **Theme Objects**: Aikeedo provides several objects that you can use in your themes. Refer to the [Theme Objects](/development/themes/objects/address) section in the documentation for details on available objects and their properties.
- **Default Theme**: For inspiration and best practices, take a look at the [Default Aikeedo theme](https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-default/).

## Best Practices

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your theme looks good on all device sizes.
2. **Accessibility**: Follow web accessibility guidelines to make your theme usable for everyone.
3. **Performance**: Optimize your assets and use caching techniques to keep your theme fast.
