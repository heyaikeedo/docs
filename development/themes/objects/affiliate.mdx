The `affiliate` object is providing access to essential affiliate information for users participating in the affiliate program. This object is part of the user object and contains details about the user's affiliate status, earnings, and payout preferences.

## Availability

The `affiliate` object is always available as a property of the `user` object when a user is logged in. Affiliate accounts are automatically generated for each user, so you can safely access `user.affiliate` properties without additional checks for its existence.
