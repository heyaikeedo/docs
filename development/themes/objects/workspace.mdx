---

The `workspace` object is a fundamental component in Aikeedo themes, representing a user's working environment and associated settings. This object contains crucial information about the workspace, including subscription details, credit usage, and various configuration options.

## Availability

The `workspace` object is available globally when a user is logged into the app. Additionally, it is always accessible as a property of the `user` object. Each user has at least one workspace, so you can safely access `workspace` properties or `user.workspace` properties without additional checks for their existence.

## Properties

The `workspace` object contains the following properties:

<ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
  A unique identifier for the workspace, always in UUID version 4 format (e.g., "018d5355-c857-7044-8284-83e7950685b4").
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the workspace (e.g., "Personal").
