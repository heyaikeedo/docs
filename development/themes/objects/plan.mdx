The `Plan` object represents a subscription plan in Aikeedo themes, providing access to essential plan information. This object is part of the `plans` array, which is globally accessible, allowing you to easily incorporate plan-specific data and functionality into your theme.

## Availability

The `Plan` objects are available globally as part of the `plans` array. You can iterate through this array to access individual plan objects and their properties.

<Note>
  It's a good practice to check if the `plans` array exists and has elements before attempting to access individual plan objects.
