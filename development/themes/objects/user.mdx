---

The `user` object is a fundamental component in Aikeedo themes, providing access to essential user information when a user is logged into their account. This object is globally accessible, allowing you to easily incorporate user-specific data and functionality into your theme.

## Availability

The `user` object is available globally when a user is logged in. If no user is logged in, the object will be undefined. Always check for the existence of the `user` object before attempting to access its properties.

<Note>
  It's a good practice to use conditional checks when working with the `user` object to ensure your theme functions correctly for both logged-in and guest users.
</Note>
