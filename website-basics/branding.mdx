## Accessing Branding Settings

To access the branding settings:

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel
2. Navigate to the "Settings" section in the left sidebar
3. Under the "Branding" category, you'll find options for "Logo" and "Appearance"

<Note>

## Logo Settings

Your logo is often the first thing users notice about your brand. Aikeedo allows you to customize various logo elements:

### Favicon

The favicon is the small icon that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.

- Click on "Browse files" to upload your favicon
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, ICO, or SVG
- Recommended size: 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels for better quality on high-resolution displays

### Primary Logo

The primary logo is used in the header of your website and emails.

- Upload separate logos for light and dark modes
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, ICO, or SVG
- Recommended size: Varies depending on your design, but ensure it's clear and legible

### Alternative Logo

The alternative logo is typically used in the footer of your website and emails.

- Upload separate logos for light and dark modes
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, ICO, or SVG
- Recommended size: Usually smaller than the primary logo

<Tip>
  For the best results, use SVG format for your logos. SVGs are scalable and will look crisp on all devices and screen sizes.

## Appearance Settings

Customize the color scheme and overall look of your Aikeedo instance:

### Color Schemes

- **Light mode**: Enable or disable light mode for your users
- **Dark mode**: Enable or disable dark mode for your users
- **Default color scheme**: Choose between "System" (follows user's device settings) or set a specific default

### Accent Colors

- **Accent color**: The primary brand color used for buttons, links, and highlights
- **Accent text color**: The color of text that appears on elements using the accent color

<Note>
  These settings apply to both the admin panel and user interface. However, they may not affect the landing page, depending on your chosen theme.

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to create a professional brand identity:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent branding across all touchpoints including website, emails, and notifications
2. **Readability**: Choose colors with sufficient contrast to ensure text remains easily readable
3. **File Optimization**: Compress image files to ensure fast loading without sacrificing quality
4. **SVG Format**: Use SVG format for logos when possible for scalability across all devices
5. **Testing**: Preview your branding in both light and dark modes before finalizing

<Tip>
Test your color choices with accessibility tools to ensure they meet WCAG contrast requirements for all users.
