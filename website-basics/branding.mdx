Branding is a crucial aspect of any application, especially when you're offering a service to your customers. Aikeedo provides a range of options to help you tailor the look and feel of your instance to match your brand. This guide will walk you through the various branding settings available in Aikeedo.

## Accessing Branding Settings

To access the branding settings:

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel
2. Navigate to the "Settings" section in the left sidebar
3. Under the "Branding" category, you'll find options for "Logo" and "Appearance"

<Note>
  The branding settings affect both the admin panel and the user-facing parts of your Aikeedo instance.

## Logo Settings

Your logo is often the first thing users notice about your brand. Aikeedo allows you to customize various logo elements:

### Favicon

The favicon is the small icon that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.

- Click on "Browse files" to upload your favicon
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, ICO, or SVG
- Recommended size: 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels for better quality on high-resolution displays

### Primary Logo

The primary logo is used in the header of your website and emails.

- Upload separate logos for light and dark modes
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, ICO, or SVG
- Recommended size: Varies depending on your design, but ensure it's clear and legible

### Alternative Logo

The alternative logo is typically used in the footer of your website and emails.

- Upload separate logos for light and dark modes
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, ICO, or SVG
- Recommended size: Usually smaller than the primary logo

<Tip>
  For the best results, use SVG format for your logos. SVGs are scalable and will look crisp on all devices and screen sizes.
</Tip>

## Appearance Settings

Customize the color scheme and overall look of your Aikeedo instance:

### Color Schemes

- **Light mode**: Enable or disable light mode for your users
- **Dark mode**: Enable or disable dark mode for your users
- **Default color scheme**: Choose between "System" (follows user's device settings) or set a specific default

### Accent Colors

- **Accent color**: The primary brand color used for buttons, links, and highlights
- **Accent text color**: The color of text that appears on elements using the accent color

<Note>
  These settings apply to both the admin panel and user interface. However, they may not affect the landing page, depending on your chosen theme.

## Best Practices for Branding

1. **Consistency**: Ensure your branding elements are consistent across all touchpoints (website, emails, app icon)
2. **Readability**: Choose colors that provide good contrast and ensure text remains easily readable
3. **File optimization**: Compress your image files to ensure fast loading times without sacrificing quality

By carefully configuring these branding settings, you can create a unique and professional look for your Aikeedo instance that resonates with your target audience and reinforces your brand identity.
