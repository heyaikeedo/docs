## Website Information

### Website Name

The website name appears throughout your platform and represents your brand.

- Locate the "Name" field under the "Website" section
- Enter your brand name or platform title
- Example: "AI Wizard" or "AI Wizard Platform"

<Tip>
Choose a memorable name that clearly communicates your platform's purpose to users.
</Tip>

### Site Domain

Configure your website's domain for proper functionality.

- Enter your domain name in the "Site Domain" field
- **Important:** Include only domain, subdomain (if any) and port number (if any)
- **Do not include** protocol (http/https) or path
- Omit port number if it's 80 or 443
- Example: `demo.aikeedo.com` or `mysite.com:8080`

<Warning>
Incorrect domain configuration can cause authentication and payment gateway issues. Make sure to enter only the domain without http:// or https://.
</Warning>

### SSL Configuration

Enable SSL for secure connections and required features.

- Toggle "Is SSL Enabled?" to "Yes" if you have an SSL certificate installed
- SSL is required for various features like SSO and Payment Gateways
- It's highly recommended to enable SSL for production environments

<Note>
Only enable SSL if you have a valid SSL certificate installed on your server. Enabling without a certificate will cause connection errors.
</Note>

### Landing Page

Control the first page visitors see when they arrive at your site.

- Enable this toggle to display the default landing page
- When disabled, visitors are redirected to the login page

<Note>
If you plan to publicly market your platform, keep the landing page enabled to showcase your services to potential users.
</Note>

### Default App Page

Set the default page users see after logging in.

- Enter the path for your default app page (e.g., `/app`)
- This setting will be used as the default page for users when they login
- Admins will always be redirected to the admin dashboard regardless of this setting

<Tip>
Common values include `/app`, `/app/chat`, or `/app/video` depending on your platform's structure.
</Tip>

### Keywords

2. Enter relevant keywords for your AI service, separated by commas.
3. Example: "AI assistant, machine learning, natural language processing, chatbot"

<Tip>
  Choose keywords that accurately describe your service and that potential users might search for. Don't overstuff with keywords; focus on the most relevant ones.
</Tip>

### Description

1. Find the "Description" field in the SEO section.
2. Write a concise, compelling description of your AI service (typically 150-160 characters).
3. This description may appear in search engine results, so make it informative and engaging.
