## Accessing General Settings

To begin configuring your site's title and meta information, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to the Admin Panel:**
   Access the Aikeedo admin panel using your administrator credentials.

2. **Navigate to General Settings:**
   In the admin panel sidebar, click on **Settings**, then select **General**.

## Configuring Website Information

In the General Settings page, you'll find several important options to customize your website's basic information and behavior.

### Website Name

The website name is one of the most important branding elements for your Aikeedo platform.

1. Locate the "Name" field under the "Website" section.
2. Enter your desired site name. This could be your brand name, organization name, or a descriptive title for your AI service.
3. Example: If your AI service is called "AI Wizard," you might enter "AI Wizard" or "AI Wizard - Intelligent Assistance Platform."

### Site Domain

Properly setting your site domain is crucial for various system functionalities and SEO.

1. Find the "Site Domain" field.
2. Enter your domain name without the protocol (http:// or https://) and without any paths.
3. If you're using a non-standard port, include it (e.g., "example.com:8080").
4. For local development, you might use "localhost" or "localhost:8000".

<Note>
  Include only the domain, subdomain (if any), and port number (if non-standard). Do not include protocols or paths. Omit the port number if it's 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
</Note>

### SSL Configuration

Enabling SSL is highly recommended for security and is required for certain features.

1. Locate the "Is SSL Enabled?" toggle.
2. If you have an SSL certificate installed on your server, switch this to "Yes."

<Warning>
  Only enable SSL if you have properly installed an SSL certificate on your server. SSL is required for features like secure payment gateways.
</Warning>

### Landing Page

The landing page is the first page visitors see when they arrive at your site.

1. Find the "Landing Page" toggle.
2. Enable this option to show the default, built-in landing page.
3. If disabled, users will be redirected to the login page.


## SEO Optimization

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is vital for improving your site's visibility in search results.

### Keywords

1. In the "SEO" section, locate the "Keywords" field.
2. Enter relevant keywords for your AI service, separated by commas.
3. Example: "AI assistant, machine learning, natural language processing, chatbot"

<Tip>
  Choose keywords that accurately describe your service and that potential users might search for. Don't overstuff with keywords; focus on the most relevant ones.
</Tip>

### Description

1. Find the "Description" field in the SEO section.
2. Write a concise, compelling description of your AI service (typically 150-160 characters).
3. This description may appear in search engine results, so make it informative and engaging.

## Saving Your Changes

After configuring your title and meta information:

1. Review all the changes you've made.
2. Click the "Save changes" button at the bottom of the page.
3. Wait for the confirmation message to ensure your settings have been updated successfully.
