Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine the best of web and mobile apps, offering a fast, reliable, and engaging user experience. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring PWA settings for your Aikeedo application.

## What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. PWAs are designed to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.

<Note>
PWAs can offer features like offline functionality, push notifications, and home screen installation, providing a native app-like experience to your users.

## Configuring Your PWA

To set up your Aikeedo application as a PWA, follow these steps:

### 1. Enable PWA Functionality

First, ensure that the PWA feature is enabled for your application:

1. Navigate to the PWA settings page in your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Locate the "Status" toggle switch.
3. Ensure it is set to "Enabled" (the switch should be green).

### 2. Basic Configuration

Fill in the following fields to customize your PWA:

- **Name**: Enter the full name of your application (e.g., "Aikeedo").
- **Short Name**: Provide a shorter version of your app name, which will be used when space is limited (e.g., on device home screens).
- **Display**: Choose how you want your app to appear when launched. The "Minimal" option provides a streamlined user interface.
- **Description**: Write a brief description of your application (e.g., "All-in-one AI tool").

### 3. Visual Customization

Customize the look of your PWA with these settings:

- **Theme Color**: Enter a hexadecimal color code (e.g., "#ffffff") to set the primary theme color of your PWA. This color may be used in the browser's address bar or other UI elements.
- **Background Color**: Specify a hexadecimal color code (e.g., "#3F4246") for the background color of the splash screen that appears when your PWA is launched.

### 4. App Icon

The app icon is crucial for brand recognition and will be displayed on the user's home screen or app launcher:

1. Click the "Browse files" button next to "App icon".
2. Upload an image that meets the following criteria:
   - Recommended size: 512x512 pixels
   - Supported formats: PNG, SVG, or WEBP
   - Ensure the icon is visually appealing and recognizable at smaller sizes

### 5. Maskable Icon

Maskable icons adapt to different device requirements by allowing the icon to fill the entire shape provided by the device's operating system:

1. Toggle the "Maskable icon" switch to "Enabled" if you want your icon to be maskable.
2. Ensure your uploaded icon has some padding around the main content to accommodate different mask shapes.

### 6. Save Your Changes

After configuring all the settings, click the "Save changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply your PWA configuration.
