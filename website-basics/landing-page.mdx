## Overview

The landing page is the first impression visitors get of your Aikeedo platform. This guide covers how to customize images, text, and theme files safely.

<Warning>
Changes made directly to the default theme will be overwritten during app updates. Always duplicate the theme before making customizations.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Directory Note**: If you've replaced the default `public` directory with `public_html` (common in cPanel environments), replace `public` with `public_html` in all file paths throughout this guide.
</Note>

## Landing Page Options

Aikeedo offers flexibility in how you manage your landing page:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Option 1: Customize the Default Landing Page">
Use Aikeedo's built-in landing page and customize it to match your brand. This option gives you full control while staying within the Aikeedo ecosystem.

**Best for:** Users who want to customize the existing design without external tools.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 2: Use Third-Party Landing Page">
Install Aikeedo on a subdomain (`app.yourdomain.com`) and disable the default landing page. Create your main landing page using external services like Framer, WordPress, Webflow, or Squarespace, then point your main domain (`yourdomain.com`) to your third-party landing page.

**How it works:** Main domain shows your custom landing page, while the subdomain handles Aikeedo functionality (authorized users go to dashboard, unauthorized visitors see login page).

**Best for:** Users who want complete design freedom with specialized landing page builders.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 3: Use Marketplace Themes">
Browse and install pre-built themes from our [Marketplace](https://aikeedo.com/marketplace/). These professionally designed themes are ready to use and can be customized to match your brand.

**Best for:** Users who want professional designs without starting from scratch.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 4: Build Your Own Theme">
Create custom themes tailored to your specific needs. You can build themes yourself or have our team create them for you.

**For developers:**
- Start with our minimal [Theme Starter Kit](https://github.com/heyaikeedo/themes-starter) - the same foundation we use internally
- Follow our comprehensive [Theme Development Guide](/development/themes/development-guide) for detailed instructions

**For custom development:**
- Contact [sales@aikeedo.com](mailto:sales@aikeedo.com) to have our team create custom themes for you

**Best for:** Users who need unique designs or have specific branding requirements.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customize the Default Landing Page

To customize Aikeedo's default landing page, you'll need to duplicate the theme first to protect your changes from being overwritten during updates.

<Steps>
<Step title="Duplicate the Theme Directory">
  Copy the default theme to a new location:
  
  ```bash
  # From
  /extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/default
  
  # To
  /extra/extensions/yourorganization/themename
  ```
  
  Replace `yourorganization` and `themename` with your preferred names.
</Step>

<Step title="Update composer.json">
  In your duplicated theme directory, update the `composer.json` file to reflect the new theme name:
  
  ```json
  {
    "name": "yourorganization/themename"
  }
  ```
  
  The name must match the new directory structure.
</Step>

<Step title="Duplicate Theme Assets">
  Copy the theme assets to match your new theme:
  
  ```bash
  # From
  /public/e/heyaikeedo/default
  
  # To
  /public/e/yourorganization/themename
  ```
  
  <Note>
  If using `public_html`, replace `public` with `public_html` in the paths above.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Activate Your Theme">
  1. Navigate to the admin panel
  2. Go to **Themes** page
  3. Find your new theme in the list
  4. Click **Activate** to enable it
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Debug Mode and Disable Cache">
  For development, you need to enable debug mode and disable app cache:
  
  1. Navigate to the **Status** page in your admin panel
  2. **Enable Debug Mode**: This allows you to see changes in real-time during development
  3. **Disable App Cache**: Disable all caching options on the same page
  
  <Warning>
  Debug mode and disabled cache should never be enabled in production as they significantly impact performance.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Make Your Changes">
  Edit files in your custom theme directory:
  - **Modify TWIG templates**: Aikeedo uses TWIG for HTML views (`.twig` files)
  - Update CSS styles
  - Add custom JavaScript
  - Replace images
  
  <Tip>
  TWIG templates are located in the `views` directory of your theme. Look for `.twig` files to modify the HTML structure.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Disable Debug Mode and Re-enable Cache">
  Once you've completed and tested your changes:
  1. Navigate to the **Status** page in your admin panel
  2. **Disable Debug Mode** for optimal performance
  3. **Re-enable App Cache** for production
  
</Step>

<Step title="Clear Cache">
  If you have any caching enabled, clear the application cache from the admin panel's Status page after making changes.
  <Check>
  Your customizations are now protected from being overwritten during updates.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Theme File Locations

Understanding where theme files are located helps you customize effectively:

### Asset Files (CSS, JS, Images)

```
/public/e/heyaikeedo/default/
```

Contains all frontend assets including:
- Stylesheets (CSS)
- JavaScript files
- Images and icons

### HTML View Files

```
/extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/default/
```

Contains template files that generate the HTML structure.

## Quick Customizations

### Updating the Hero Image

The hero image is located at:

```
/public/e/heyaikeedo/default/assets/preview.webp
```

To update the hero image:

1. Replace the existing `preview.webp` file with your new image
2. Keep the same filename (`preview.webp`)
3. Clear your browser cache to see the changes

<Tip>
For best results, use WebP format for optimal performance and loading speed.
</Tip>

### Updating Text Content

Text content should be updated through localization files for proper multilingual support.

Localization files are located at:

```
/extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/default/locale
```

See the [Localization guide](/advanced/localization) for detailed instructions on managing text translations.

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for successful landing page customization:

1. **Always Duplicate**: Never edit the default theme directly
2. **Version Control**: Keep your custom theme under version control (Git)
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test changes across different browsers and devices
4. **Optimize Assets**: Compress images and minify CSS/JS for better performance
5. **Document Changes**: Keep notes on customizations for future reference
6. **Regular Backups**: Backup your custom theme before major changes

<Tip>
If you only need to change colors and logos, consider using the [Branding settings](/website-basics/branding) instead of creating a custom theme.
</Tip>
