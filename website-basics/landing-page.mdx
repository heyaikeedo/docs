## Overview

The landing page is the first impression visitors get of your Aikeedo platform. This guide covers how to customize images, text, and theme files safely.

<Warning>
Changes made directly to the default theme will be overwritten during app updates. Always duplicate the theme before making customizations.
</Warning>

## Quick Customizations

### Updating the Hero Image

The hero image is located at:

```
/public/e/heyaikeedo/default/assets/preview.webp
```

<Note>
If you've replaced the default `public` directory with `public_html` (common in cPanel environments), the path will be `/public_html/e/heyaikeedo/default/assets/preview.webp`
</Note>

To update the hero image:

1. Replace the existing `preview.webp` file with your new image
2. Keep the same filename (`preview.webp`)
3. Clear your browser cache to see the changes

<Tip>
For best results, use WebP format for optimal performance and loading speed.
</Tip>

### Updating Text Content

Text content should be updated through localization files for proper multilingual support.

Localization files are located at:

```
/extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/default/locale
```

See the [Localization guide](/advanced/localization) for detailed instructions on managing text translations.

## Theme File Locations

Understanding where theme files are located helps you customize effectively:

### Asset Files (CSS, JS, Images)

```
/public/e/heyaikeedo/default/
```

Contains all frontend assets including:
- Stylesheets (CSS)
- JavaScript files
- Images and icons

### HTML View Files

```
/extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/default/
```

Contains template files that generate the HTML structure.

## Safe Theme Customization

To protect your customizations from being overwritten during updates, create a custom theme:

<Steps>
<Step title="Duplicate the Theme Directory">
  Copy the default theme to a new location:
  
  ```bash
  # From
  /extra/extensions/heyaikeedo/default
  
  # To
  /extra/extensions/yourorganization/themename
  ```
  
  Replace `yourorganization` and `themename` with your preferred names.
</Step>

<Step title="Update composer.json">
  In your duplicated theme directory, update the `composer.json` file to reflect the new theme name:
  
  ```json
  {
    "name": "yourorganization/themename"
  }
  ```
  
  The name must match the new directory structure.
</Step>

<Step title="Duplicate Theme Assets">
  Copy the theme assets to match your new theme:
  
  ```bash
  # From
  /public/e/heyaikeedo/default
  
  # To
  /public/e/yourorganization/themename
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Activate Your Theme">
  1. Navigate to the admin panel
  2. Go to **Themes** page
  3. Find your new theme in the list
  4. Click **Activate** to enable it
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Debug Mode">
  Enable debug mode in your Aikeedo configuration to see changes in real-time during development.
  
  <Note>
  Debug mode helps you identify issues but should never be enabled in production.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Make Your Changes">
  Edit files in your custom theme directory:
  - Modify HTML views
  - Update CSS styles
  - Add custom JavaScript
  - Replace images
</Step>

<Step title="Clear Cache">
  After making changes, clear the application cache from the admin panel's Status page.
</Step>

<Step title="Disable Debug Mode">
  Once you've completed and tested your changes, disable debug mode for optimal performance.

  Your customizations are now protected from being overwritten during updates.

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for successful landing page customization:

1. **Always Duplicate**: Never edit the default theme directly
2. **Version Control**: Keep your custom theme under version control (Git)
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test changes across different browsers and devices
4. **Optimize Assets**: Compress images and minify CSS/JS for better performance
5. **Document Changes**: Keep notes on customizations for future reference
6. **Regular Backups**: Backup your custom theme before major changes

<Tip>
If you only need to change colors and logos, consider using the [Branding settings](/website-basics/branding) instead of creating a custom theme.
</Tip>
