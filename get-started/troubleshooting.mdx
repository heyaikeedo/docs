## Overview

This guide provides solutions to common issues users encounter when installing, configuring, and running Aikeedo. Issues are organized by category for easy navigation.

## Before You Begin

Before troubleshooting, verify that:

1. Your server meets all [server requirements](/overview/server-requirements)
2. You have the latest version of Aikeedo files
3. You've followed the [installation guide](/get-started/installation) carefully
4. You've completed [initial setup](/get-started/initial-setup) steps

## Installation Issues

### Assets Not Loading (CSS, JS, Images Missing)

**Symptoms:**
- Installation page appears without styling
- Images, CSS, and JavaScript files fail to load
- Browser shows 404 errors for asset files

**Cause:**
The domain is not correctly pointing to the `public` directory.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Document Root">
  Ensure your domain points to the `public` directory within your Aikeedo installation:
  
  ```
  /path/to/aikeedo/public
  ```
  
  Not to the root Aikeedo directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Redirection">
  Visit your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`). You should be automatically redirected to `https://yourdomain.com/install`.
  
  <Check>
  If the redirect works, your domain is configured correctly.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="cPanel Users">
  If you're using cPanel and cannot change the document root for your main domain, follow the dedicated [cPanel Installation Guide](/get-started/installation/cpanel).
  
  <Note>
  The cPanel installation process differs from the standard installation due to control panel limitations.
  </Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

### 404 or 403 Errors During Installation

**Symptoms:**
- 404 error when accessing `/install`
- 403 Forbidden error on home page
- Installation wizard not accessible

**Cause:**
Domain document root not pointing to the `public` directory, missing files, or incorrect permissions.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Document Root">
  Ensure your domain's document root points to the `public` folder:
  
  **For cPanel:**
  - Main domain: Should point to `public_html` which should be the `public` directory
  - Add-on domains/subdomains: Update document root in cPanel to point to the `public` folder
  
  **For VPS/Dedicated:**
  - Set document root to `/path/to/aikeedo/public`
</Step>

<Step title="Check File Extraction">
  Verify all Aikeedo files are extracted correctly and the `public` directory exists with all necessary files.
</Step>

<Step title="Set File Permissions">
  Ensure the web server has appropriate permissions:
  
  ```bash
  # Set directory permissions
  find /path/to/aikeedo -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
  
  # Set file permissions
  find /path/to/aikeedo -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify .htaccess File">
  Ensure the `.htaccess` file is present in the `public` directory.
  
  <Note>
  Hidden files may not be visible by default. Enable "Show hidden files" in your FTP client or file manager.
  </Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot connect to database during installation
- Database error messages in installation wizard
- Installation fails at database configuration step

**Cause:**
Incorrect database credentials, missing database, or insufficient permissions.

**Solution:**

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Verify Database Credentials">
  Double-check all database connection details:
  - **Database name**: Must be exact (case-sensitive)
  - **Username**: Database user with proper permissions
  - **Password**: Correct password for the database user
  - **Host**: Usually `localhost`, but may be different on some hosts
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check Database Server">
  - Ensure the database server (MySQL/MariaDB) is running
  - Verify the database is accessible from your web server
  - Confirm the database exists and is empty
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verify User Permissions">
  The database user must have these permissions:
  - SELECT
  - INSERT
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE
  - CREATE
  - DROP
  - INDEX
  - ALTER
  
  <Tip>
  If unsure, grant ALL PRIVILEGES to the database user for the specific database.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check PHP Extensions">
  Verify that required PHP database extensions are installed:
  - `mysqli` for MySQL
  - `pdo_mysql` for PDO support
  
  Check with:
  ```bash
  php -m | grep -i mysql
  ```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If problems persist, try creating a new database and user with full permissions.

## Database Issues

### MySQL Server Has Gone Away

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: "MySQL server has gone away"
- Database connection drops during requests
- Long-running operations fail

**Cause:**
MySQL server timeout or packet size limitations.

**Solution:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Server Timeout Fix">
  **Problem:** MySQL server times out and closes the connection.
  
  **Solution:** Update your `my.cnf` configuration file:
  
  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  wait_timeout = 28800
  ```
  
  This sets the timeout to 8 hours. Adjust as needed for your use case.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Packet Size Fix">
  **Problem:** MySQL receives packets that are too large or incorrect.
  
  **Solution:** Increase the max packet size in `my.cnf`:
  
  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  max_allowed_packet = 128M
  ```
  
  This allows larger data packets to be processed.
</Tab>

<Tab title="InnoDB Log Size">
  **Problem:** InnoDB log file size is insufficient.
  
  **Solution:** Increase the log file size in `my.cnf`:
  
  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  innodb_log_file_size = 128M
  ```
  
  Or larger, depending on your data volume.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
After modifying `my.cnf`, you must restart your MySQL server for changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

or

```bash
sudo service mysql restart
```
</Warning>

**Finding my.cnf:**

Common locations for the MySQL configuration file:
- Linux: `/etc/my.cnf` or `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`
- macOS: `/etc/my.cnf`
- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server X.X\my.ini`

<Note>
If you're on shared hosting and don't have access to `my.cnf`, contact your hosting provider to request these changes.
</Note>

## Feature-Specific Issues

### Auto-Generated Titles Don't Match Content Language

**Symptoms:**
- AI generates titles in English when content is in another language
- Title language doesn't match the generated content language

**Cause:**
AI models sometimes generate titles in their default language despite instructions.

**Solution:**

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Option 1: Modify Prompts">
  Customize the title generation prompts in these files:
  
  ```
  /src/Ai/Infrastructure/Services/OpenAi/TitleGeneratorService.php
  /src/Ai/Infrastructure/Services/Anthropic/TitleGeneratorService.php
  /src/Ai/Infrastructure/Services/Cohere/TitleGeneratorService.php
  ```

  <Warning>
  Custom code modifications will need to be reapplied after app updates.
  </Warning>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Option 2: Try Different Models">
  Some AI models are better at following language instructions than others:
  
  1. Navigate to **Settings > Models**
  2. Enable alternative models (e.g., GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5)
  3. Test title generation with different models
  4. Use the model that best respects language instructions
  
  <Tip>
  Claude models often excel at following specific language instructions.
  </Tip>

### Uploaded Files Return 404 Not Found Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Uploaded files show "not found" or 404 errors
- Generated files (images, audio, documents) are inaccessible
- Files exist in storage but cannot be accessed via URL
- Browser shows 404 when clicking file links

**Cause:**
File grouping enabled on local storage, secure URLs enabled, incorrect document root configuration, or file permission issues.

**Solution:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Disable File Grouping (if using local storage)">
  If you're experiencing file access issues with local storage, try disabling file grouping:
  
  1. Log in to the admin panel
  2. Navigate to **Settings > Storage**
  3. Locate the "File Grouping" option
  4. Change the value from "Workspace" (or any other option) to **"None"**
  5. Click "Save changes"
  
  <Note>
  File grouping and secure URLs are optimized for cloud storage (S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.) and may cause compatibility issues on some local storage configurations, particularly on cPanel-based hosting. If files are inaccessible, disabling these options often resolves the issue.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Disable Secure URLs">
  If you're using local storage without special security requirements:
  
  1. In **Settings > Storage**
  2. Locate the "Secure URLs" option
  3. **Turn off** the "Secure URLs" option
  4. Click "Save changes"
  
  <Warning>
  If files were uploaded with Secure URLs enabled, you may need to re-upload them after disabling this option.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Document Root Configuration">
  If your domain's document root is set to `public_html` instead of `public`:
  
  1. Open your `.env` file in the root directory
  2. Find the line with `PUBLIC_DIR` (it may be commented out with `#`)
  3. Ensure it's set correctly:
     ```bash
     PUBLIC_DIR=public_html
     ```
  4. Remove the `#` symbol if present at the beginning
  5. Save the file
  
  <Note>
  This is particularly important for cPanel users where the default document root is `public_html`.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Check File Permissions">
  Ensure the web server has read access to uploaded files:
  
  ```bash
  # Navigate to your Aikeedo directory
  cd /path/to/aikeedo
  
  # Set correct permissions for storage directory
  chmod -R 755 storage/
  
  # Set correct ownership (replace www-data with your web server user)
  chown -R www-data:www-data storage/
  ```
  
  Common web server users:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `www-data`
  - CentOS/RHEL: `apache`
  - Nginx: `nginx`
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Storage Path">
  Check that your storage path is correctly configured:
  
  1. Go to **Settings > Storage** in the admin panel
  2. Verify the storage driver is set correctly (Local, S3, etc.)
  3. If using local storage, ensure the path is correct
  4. Test by uploading a new file
  
  <Check>
  If the new file is accessible, the configuration is correct. You may need to re-upload older files.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Clear Application Cache">
  After making configuration changes:
  
  1. Navigate to **Status** page in the admin panel
  2. Click "Clear cache" to clear the application cache
  3. Test file access again
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For production environments requiring secure file access or workspace-based file organization, cloud storage (S3, DigitalOcean Spaces) is recommended. File grouping and secure URL features are optimized for cloud storage and work most reliably in that environment, though they may also work on some local storage configurations.
</Tip>
