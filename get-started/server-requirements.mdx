Welcome to the Server Requirements guide for Aikeedo. This page outlines the necessary components and configurations to ensure your server is ready to host Aikeedo efficiently. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to server management, we've got you covered with clear, easy-to-follow instructions.

## Core Requirements

### PHP and MySQL Versions

Aikeedo requires up-to-date versions of PHP and MySQL to ensure optimal performance and security:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="PHP Version" icon="php">
    8.2 or later
  </Card>
  <Card title="MySQL Version" icon="database">
    8.0 or later
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Using the latest stable versions is recommended for the best experience and to take advantage of the newest features and security updates.
</Note>

### Essential PHP Extensions

To run Aikeedo smoothly, make sure your PHP installation includes these extensions:

  - ctype
  - curl
  - dom
  - fileinfo
  - intl
  - json
  - libxml
  - mbstring
  - openssl
  - pcre
  - phar
  - simplexml
  - tokenizer
  - xml
  - xmlwriter
  - zip
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Most of these extensions are typically included in standard PHP installations. If you're unsure, consult your hosting provider or server administrator.

## Minimum Server Requirements

To ensure optimal performance of Aikeedo, we recommend the following minimum server specifications:

  <Card title="Memory" icon="memory">
    2 GB RAM or more
  </Card>
  <Card title="CPU" icon="microchip">
    2 vCPUs or more
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  For our demo environment, we use a VPS with 4 GB Memory and 2 Intel vCPUs on DigitalOcean. This setup provides excellent performance for most use cases.
</Note>

### Hosting Recommendations

While Aikeedo can run on various hosting environments, we strongly recommend using a Virtual Private Server (VPS) for better control and performance, especially for commercial use cases.

<Tip>
  Start with a smaller VPS configuration and resize as needed. This approach allows you to scale your resources based on your actual usage and growth.
</Tip>

Popular VPS providers that work well with Aikeedo include:

- DigitalOcean (Use our [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/084136521a6a) for $200 in credits, valid for 60 days)
- Vultr (Use our [referral link](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9668473-9J) for $300 in credits, valid for 30 days)
- Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))

<Note>
  While most shared hosting environments are supported, they may have limitations that could affect Aikeedo's performance. For the best experience, especially for commercial use, we strongly advise using a VPS.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Special note about Cloudways: The text streaming function doesn't work on Cloudways servers due to their complicated server stack. Unfortunately, they don't provide root access to the server to modify the configuration. This issue cannot be resolved at the application level as it's not application-related. If text streaming is crucial for your use case, we recommend choosing a different hosting provider.
</Warning>

## PHP Configuration

Proper PHP configuration is crucial for Aikeedo to function correctly. Adjust the following settings in your `php.ini` file:

- **File Uploads:** On
- **Post Max Size:** 25MB or more
- **Upload Max Filesize:** 25MB or more

<Note>
  If you're not familiar with editing the `php.ini` file, don't worry! Many hosting control panels provide user-friendly interfaces to adjust these settings. If you need help, check out the [PHP configuration guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php) or contact your hosting provider.
</Note>

## Web Server Compatibility

Aikeedo is designed to work with popular web servers, ensuring flexibility in your hosting setup:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Apache" icon="server">
    Fully tested and supported
  </Card>
  <Card title="Nginx" icon="server">
    Fully tested and supported
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

While Apache and Nginx are our primary supported web servers, Aikeedo is built to be compatible with most standard web server configurations.
