---

Welcome to the Aikeedo installation guide for cPanel! This comprehensive tutorial will walk you through the process of setting up Aikeedo on your cPanel hosting environment. Whether you're using a main domain, an add-on domain, or a subdomain, we've got you covered.

## Before You Start

1. Ensure your server meets our [requirements](/get-started/server-requirements).
2. Prepare a database and note down its name, username, and password.
3. Have your Aikeedo purchase code ready.

## Understanding the Public Directory

It's crucial to understand how Aikeedo's file structure works with your domain:

- Aikeedo has a `public` directory that contains web-accessible files.
- Your domain should point to this `public` directory, not the root of all Aikeedo files.
- The `public` directory cannot be moved; it must remain within the Aikeedo file structure.

In cPanel, this typically meanss:
- For main domains: copying the contents of the `public` folder to your `public_html` directory.
- For add-on domains or subdomains: setting the document root to the `public` folder within your Aikeedo installation.

## Installation Process

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Main Domain">
    Follow these steps to install Aikeedo on your main domain in cPanel:

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Upload the Archive">
            - Locate the `aikeedo-server-files.zip` archive in your Aikeedo package.
            - Upload this archive to the directory one level above your `public_html` folder.
            For example, if your `public_html` path is `/home/username/public_html`, upload to `/home/username/`.

            <Note>
                If you can't find the zip file, refer to our [File Structure](/get-started/file-structure) guide.
            </Note>
        </Step>

        <Step title="Extract the Archive">
            Once uploaded, extract the contents of `aikeedo-server-files.zip` in the same directory.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Configure the Public Directory">
            - Find the `public` folder within the extracted files (e.g., `/home/username/public`).
            - **Copy** (<Tooltip tip='Moving files can lead to errors like "Fatal error: Uncaught Twig\Error\LoaderError: There are no registered paths for namespace theme."'>do not move</Tooltip>) all contents from this `public` folder to your `public_html` directory.
            - Make sure to include hidden files and folders (such as .htaccess file or .vite directory).

            <Warning>
                You'll need to manually repeat this copying step after each Aikeedo update. For more details on the update process, please refer to our [update guide](/versioning/how-to-update).
            </Warning>
        </Step>

        <Step title="Update the Environment File">
            - Locate the `.env.example` file in your Aikeedo root directory (e.g., `/home/username/`).
            - Find the line that contains `# PUBLIC_DIR=public_html`.
            - Uncomment this line by removing the `#` symbol and the space after it.
            - The final version of this line should look like:
                ```env .env.example
                PUBLIC_DIR=public_html
                ```
            - Save the changes to the file.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Begin the Installation">
            - Open your web browser and navigate to your domain.
            - You'll be automatically redirected to the installation page at `/install`.
        </Step>
        
        <Step title="Complete the Setup">
            - Follow the on-screen instructions in the installation wizard.
            - You'll need to provide:
              - Database credentials
              - Your Aikeedo purchase code
              - Admin account details
            - Complete all steps as guided by the wizard.
        </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Tab title="Add-on Domain or Subdomain">
    Follow these steps to install Aikeedo on an add-on domain or subdomain in cPanel:

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Upload the Archive">
            - Locate the `aikeedo-server-files.zip` archive in your Aikeedo package.
            - Upload this archive to your add-on domain or subdomain root directory.
            For example: `/home/username/yourdomain.com/`

            <Note>
                If you can't find the zip file, refer to our [File Structure](/get-started/file-structure) guide.
            </Note>
        </Step>

        <Step title="Extract the Archive">
            Once uploaded, extract the contents of `aikeedo-server-files.zip` in the same directory.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Update Domain Root Directory">
            - In cPanel, navigate to **Domains** > **Addon Domains** (or **Subdomains**).
            - Click **Manage** next to your domain.
            - Update the **Document Root** to point to the `public` folder within your extracted files.
                For example: `/home/username/yourdomain.com/public`
            - Save your changes.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Begin the Installation">
            - Open your web browser and navigate to your add-on domain or subdomain URL.
            - You'll be automatically redirected to the installation page at `/install`.
        </Step>

        <Step title="Complete the Setup">
            - Follow the on-screen instructions in the installation wizard.
            - You'll need to provide:
              - Database credentials

              - Admin account details
            - Complete all steps as guided by the wizard.
        </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Important Notes

- Throughout this guide, we use absolute paths (e.g., `/home/username/`). In cPanel's file manager, you might not see the `/home/username/` part. For example, `/home/username/public_html` might appear as just `/public_html`.
- Always ensure you're working in the correct directory for your specific domain setup.
- The `public` directory contains all files that should be publicly accessible. Don't confuse this with cPanel's default `public_html` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process:

1. Double-check that you've followed each step correctly.
2. Ensure all file permissions are set correctly.
3. Verify that your server meets all the [requirements](/get-started/server-requirements).
4. For more detailed troubleshooting steps, please refer to our dedicated [Troubleshooting Guide](/get-started/troubleshooting).
