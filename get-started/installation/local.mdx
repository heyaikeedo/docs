---

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Aikeedo on your local machine. This is ideal for development, testing, or personal use.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. Downloaded the Aikeedo package
2. Familiarity with command-line operations
3. A local development environment (we'll cover different options)

## Option 1: Using PHP's Built-in Server

This option is suitable if you already have PHP and MySQL installed and accessible via the command line.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Environment">
    Ensure you have:
    - PHP 8.2 or higher installed and accessible via command line
    - MySQL 8.0 or higher installed and running
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract Aikeedo Files">
    1. Locate the `aikeedo-server-files.zip` in your Aikeedo package.
    2. Extract the contents to a directory of your choice, e.g., `C:\aikeedo` or `/home/user/aikeedo`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up the Database">
    1. Open your MySQL client or command-line tool:
       - For command-line users, open your terminal and type `mysql -u root -p` to access MySQL.
       - For GUI users, open tools like phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or HeidiSQL.

    2. Create a new database for Aikeedo:
       - In the MySQL command line or GUI query window, execute the following SQL command:
       ```sql
       CREATE DATABASE aikeedo;
       ```
       - This creates a new, empty database named 'aikeedo' that will store all your Aikeedo data.

    3. Create a new user (recommended for security):
       ```sql
       CREATE USER 'aikeedo_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON aikeedo.* TO 'aikeedo_user'@'localhost';
       FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
       ```
       Replace 'your_secure_password' with a strong, unique password.

    4. Note down the following information for the installation wizard:
       - Database name: aikeedo
       - Username: aikeedo_user (or 'root' if you skipped step 3)
       - Password: The password you set (or your root password if using root)
       - Host: localhost (in most cases)

    <Note>
      If you're not comfortable with database management, consider using a database administration tool like phpMyAdmin, which often comes pre-installed with local development environments like XAMPP or MAMP.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the PHP Server">
    To start the PHP development server:

    1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
    2. Navigate to the root directory of your Aikeedo installation. This is the directory where you extracted the Aikeedo files, e.g., `C:\aikeedo` or `/home/user/aikeedo`.
    3. Once in the root directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public
    ```

    This command does the following:
    - `php -S` starts PHP's built-in development server
    - `localhost:8000` sets the server to listen on localhost at port 8000
    - `-t public` sets the document root to the `public` directory within your Aikeedo installation

    After running this command, you should see output indicating that the server is running. Keep this terminal window open to keep the server active.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Aikeedo">
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the Aikeedo installation wizard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow On-Screen Installation Wizard">
    1. Provide the database credentials you noted earlier.
    2. Enter your Aikeedo Purchase Code.
    3. Set up your admin account details.
    4. Follow any additional steps as prompted by the wizard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2: Using Local Development Environments

This option is suitable if you prefer using pre-configured local development environments like XAMPP, MAMP, or Laragon.
