If you're experiencing difficulties during the Aikeedo installation process, this guide will help you identify and resolve common issues. We'll cover various problems you might encounter and provide step-by-step solutions.

## Before You Begin

Before diving into specific issues, ensure that:

1. Your server meets all the [requirements](/get-started/server-requirements) for Aikeedo.
2. You have the latest version of Aikeedo files.
3. You've carefully followed the steps in our [main installation guide](/get-started/installation).

## Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="404 Error at /install or 403 Error at Home Page">
    If you encounter these errors:

    1. **Verify Document Root**: Ensure your domain's document root points to the `public` folder within the Aikeedo directory.
       - For main domains in cPanel: This should be the `public_html` directory.
       - For add-on domains or subdomains: Update the document root in cPanel to point to the `public` folder.

    2. **Check File Extraction**: Confirm that all Aikeedo files are extracted correctly and in the right location.

    3. **File Permissions**: Verify that the web server has appropriate permissions:
       - Read access to all files
       - Execute access to directories
       
       You can set permissions using these commands:
       ```bash
       find /path/to/aikeedo -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
       find /path/to/aikeedo -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
       ```

    4. **Hidden Files**: Ensure the `.htaccess` file is present in the `public` directory.

    If issues persist, double-check your web server configuration and consult your hosting provider's documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Connection Issues">
    If you can't connect to the database during installation:

    1. **Verify Credentials**: Double-check your database credentials:
       - Database name
       - Username
       - Password
       - Host (usually 'localhost' for most setups)

    2. **Database Server**: Ensure the database server is running and accessible from your web server.

    3. **User Permissions**: Verify that the database user has the necessary permissions:
       - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER

    4. **Database Existence**: Confirm that the specified database exists and is empty.

    5. **PHP Extensions**: Check that required PHP database extensions (e.g., `mysqli` for MySQL) are installed and enabled.

    If problems continue, try creating a new database and user, or consult your hosting provider's database management tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="500 Internal Server Error">
    If you encounter a 500 Internal Server Error before or after installation:

    1. **Error Logs**: Check your server's error logs for specific error messages. Common locations:
       - Apache: `/var/log/apache2/error.log` or `/var/log/httpd/error_log`
       - Nginx: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

    2. **PHP Version**: Verify PHP version compatibility and ensure all required PHP extensions are installed.

    3. **Folder Permissions**: Set correct ownership and permissions:
       ```bash
       chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/aikeedo
       find /path/to/aikeedo -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
       find /path/to/aikeedo -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
       ```

    4. **PHP-FPM**: If using PHP-FPM, try restarting the service:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm
       ```
       (Replace 8.2 with your PHP version)

    5. **.htaccess**: Ensure the `.htaccess` file in the `public` directory has the correct settings.

    6. **PHP Memory Limit**: Check if PHP has enough allocated memory. You can increase it in `php.ini`:
       ```ini
       memory_limit = 256M
       ```

    If the issue persists, enable PHP error reporting temporarily to get more detailed error messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Installation Wizard Not Loading">
    If the installation wizard doesn't load or you see a blank page:

    1. **PHP Errors**: Check PHP error logs for any fatal errors or warnings.

    2. **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again.

    3. **SSL/HTTPS**: If you're using HTTPS, ensure your SSL certificate is valid and properly installed.

    4. **File Permissions**: Verify that the web server can read all necessary files, especially in the `public` directory.

    5. **PHP Extensions**: Confirm all required PHP extensions are installed and enabled.

    6. **Server Resources**: Check if your server has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) to run the application.

    If problems persist, try accessing the site from a different browser or device to rule out client-side issues.

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still experiencing issues after trying the solutions above:

1. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Remove any temporary files or caches:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /path/to/aikeedo/storage/framework/cache/*
   rm -rf /path/to/aikeedo/storage/framework/views/*
   rm -rf /path/to/aikeedo/storage/framework/sessions/*
   ```

2. **Fresh Installation**: Consider starting with a fresh installation, ensuring you're using the latest Aikeedo files.

3. **Server Configuration**: Review your web server configuration (Apache, Nginx) to ensure it's set up correctly for PHP applications.

4. **PHP Configuration**: Check your `php.ini` file for any settings that might be causing issues (e.g., `max_execution_time`, `upload_max_filesize`).

5. **Hosting Environment**: If you're on shared hosting, contact your hosting provider to ensure there are no restrictions or issues on their end.
