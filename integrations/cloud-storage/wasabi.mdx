## Prerequisites

Before configuring Wasabi:

1. **Wasabi Account** - Create an account at [wasabi.com](https://wasabi.com)
2. **Bucket** - Create a bucket for your files
3. **Access Keys** - Generate API credentials
4. **Region** - Choose appropriate region

## Configuration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Bucket">
  In your Wasabi console:
  
  1. On the Wasabi menu, click **Buckets**
  2. In the upper right of the Console panel, click **Create Bucket**
  3. Enter a unique DNS-compliant bucket name (e.g., `your-app-storage`)
  4. Select the region where you want the bucket to reside
  5. Click **Create Bucket** to create immediately, or click **Next** to configure additional properties
  6. If continuing with setup, review bucket properties (versioning, logging, replication, tags) and click **Create Bucket**
  
  <Note>
  Bucket names must be globally unique across all Wasabi accounts. Names must be 3-63 characters long, begin with a lowercase letter or number, and consist of lowercase letters, numbers, periods, and/or dashes. Cannot contain underscores, end with a dash, have consecutive periods, or use dashes adjacent to periods.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Access Keys">
  Generate API credentials:
  
  1. Follow the steps in [Creating a User Account and Access Key](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/creating-a-user-account-and-access-key#creating-a-user)
  2. Create a new user account or use an existing one
  3. Generate access keys for the user
  4. Copy the **Access Key** and **Secret Key**
  5. Save credentials securely
  
  <Warning>
  Access keys provide full access to your Wasabi account. Store them securely.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure CORS">
  Set up CORS for your domain:
  
  1. Go to your bucket settings
  2. Click **Permissions** tab
  3. Scroll to **CORS Configuration**
  4. Click **Edit** button
  5. In the JSON editor, configure the CORS policy:
  
  ```json
  [
    {
      "AllowedOrigins": [
        "https://yourdomain.com",
        "https://www.yourdomain.com"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
        "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedHeaders": [
        "*"
      ],
      "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
  ]
  ```
  
  6. Click **Save**
  
  <Note>
  Wasabi uses JSON format for CORS configuration. Wasabi automatically provides CORS headers when an Origin header is present in requests, but you can also configure custom CORS policies for more specific control. For detailed CORS configuration, refer to the [official Wasabi CORS documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors). Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.
  </Note>
  
  <Warning>
  The CORS policy uses JSON format in Wasabi. Make sure your JSON syntax is valid before saving.
  </Warning>
