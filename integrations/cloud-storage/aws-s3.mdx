## Overview

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is Amazon's industry-standard object storage service, offering high durability, availability, and scalability. It's one of the most popular choices for cloud storage due to its reliability and extensive feature set.

**Key features:**
- **High durability** - 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
- **Global availability** - Multiple regions worldwide
- **Scalable storage** - Virtually unlimited storage capacity
- **Security features** - Encryption, access controls, and compliance
- **Integration ecosystem** - Works with thousands of AWS services
- **S3-compatible API** - Easy integration with existing tools

## Prerequisites

Before configuring AWS S3:

1. **AWS Account** - Create an account at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
2. **S3 Bucket** - Create a bucket for your files
3. **IAM User** - Create a user with S3 permissions
4. **API Credentials** - Generate access key and secret key
5. **Domain** - Optional custom domain for CloudFront CDN

## Configuration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Create S3 Bucket">
  In your AWS Console:
  
  1. Go to [**S3** service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
  2. Select your preferred region from the region selector in the top-right corner
  3. Click **Create bucket**
  4. Choose a unique bucket name (e.g., `your-app-storage`)
  5. Use default configuration (sufficient for most use cases)
  6. Click **Create bucket**
  
  <Note>
  Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts. Names must be 3-63 characters long, contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens, and cannot start or end with a dot or hyphen.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure IAM User">
  Create an IAM user with S3 permissions:
  
  1. Go to **IAM** > **Users** > **Create user**
  2. Enter username (e.g., `aikeedo-storage`)
  3. Leave **"Provide user access to the AWS Management Console"** unchecked (programmatic access only)
  4. Click **Next**
  5. Select **"Attach policies directly"**
  6. Search for and select **AmazonS3FullAccess** policy
  7. Click **Next** to review, then **Create user**
  8. Go to the user's **Security credentials** tab
  9. Click **Create access key**
  10. Select **"Application running outside AWS"** as the use case
  11. Click **Next** to proceed
  12. Copy the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**
  13. Save credentials securely
</Step>

<Step title="Configure CORS">
  Set up CORS for your domain:
  
  1. Go to your S3 bucket
  2. Click **Permissions** tab
  3. Scroll to **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)**
  4. Click **Edit** and add this configuration:
  
  ```json
  [
    {
      "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
      "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
      "AllowedOrigins": ["https://yourdomain.com", "https://www.yourdomain.com"]
    }
  ]
  ```
  
  5. Click **Save changes**
  
  <Note>
  Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain. For development, you can use `*` for AllowedOrigins, but this is not recommended for production.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure in Aikeedo">
  In your admin panel:
  
  1. Go to **Settings** > **Cloud storage** > **AWS S3**
  2. Toggle **Status** to **Enabled**
  3. Enter **Endpoint**: 
     - Go to your S3 bucket in AWS Console
     - Copy the **Bucket website endpoint** or use format: `https://your-bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/`
     - For example: `https://my-app-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`
  4. Select **Region** from dropdown (must match your bucket's region)
  5. Enter **Custom domain** (optional CloudFront CDN domain)
  6. Enter **Bucket name**: Your S3 bucket name
  7. Enter **Path prefix** (optional subfolder)
  8. Enter **Access key**: Your IAM access key ID
  9. Enter **Secret key**: Your IAM secret access key
  10. Click **Save changes**
</Step>

<Step title="Activate AWS S3">
  Enable AWS S3 as your storage provider:
  
  1. Go to **Settings** > **File storage**
  2. In the **Adapter** dropdown, select **AWS S3**
  3. Configure **Group files** and **Secure URLs** as needed
  4. Click **Save changes**
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Fields

**Required fields:**
- **Endpoint** - S3 bucket endpoint URL (e.g., `https://your-bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/`)
- **Region** - AWS region where your bucket is located
- **Bucket name** - Name of your S3 bucket
- **Access key** - IAM user access key ID for authentication
- **Secret key** - IAM user secret access key for authentication

**Optional fields:**
- **Custom domain** - Custom domain for CloudFront CDN (if you have CloudFront distribution set up)
- **Path prefix** - Optional subfolder within your bucket for organizing files

## Troubleshooting

**Access denied errors:**
- Verify IAM user has correct permissions for the specific bucket
- Check bucket policy settings and public access settings
- Ensure access keys are valid and not expired
- Verify bucket name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**CORS issues:**
- Check CORS configuration in S3 bucket permissions
- Verify allowed origins include your domain (with https://)
- Ensure allowed methods include GET (sufficient for Aikeedo)
- Wait a few minutes for CORS changes to propagate

**Files not uploading:**
- Verify bucket name and region are correct
- Check network connectivity to AWS
- Ensure bucket exists and is accessible
- Verify endpoint URL format is correct
- Check if bucket has any restrictions or policies blocking uploads

**Performance issues:**
- Consider using CloudFront CDN for better global performance
- Check if you're using the correct region for your users
- Monitor AWS CloudWatch for any service issues
