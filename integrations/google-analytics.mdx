## What This Integration Does

- Tracks page views across your Aikeedo website
- Monitors basic user interactions and behavior
- Provides insights on user demographics and interests (if enabled in your Google Analytics settings)
- Helps you understand which pages are most visited

## Best Practices

To make the most of your Google Analytics integration:

- Regularly check your Google Analytics dashboard for insights on page views and user behavior.
- Use the data to inform decisions about content creation and website improvements.
- Consider setting up custom events or enhanced measurement in your Google Analytics account for more detailed tracking.
- Familiarize yourself with Google Analytics 4 features to maximize the value of the collected data.
- Respect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations like GDPR.
- If you need more advanced tracking (e.g., custom events, goal conversions), consider working with a developer to implement custom Google Analytics code.

<Note>
  This integration injects the default Google Analytics script. While it provides valuable basic insights, setting up advanced features like goal tracking may require additional custom implementation.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing data in your Google Analytics account:

1. Verify that you've entered the correct Measurement ID in Aikeedo.
2. Allow 24-48 hours for data to start appearing in your Google Analytics dashboard.
3. Use Google's real-time reports to check if current traffic is being tracked.
4. Ensure you don't have any ad-blocking software that might interfere with Analytics.
5. Check if you need to accept terms or complete any additional setup steps in your Google Analytics account.

<Note>
  Remember that Google Analytics data is not real-time for most reports. There's usually a delay of several hours before data appears in your standard reports.
