## Introduction

Aikeedo's Intercom integration allows you to add powerful customer messaging and support capabilities to your platform. By integrating Intercom, you can engage with your users in real-time, provide support, and gather valuable insights about your customer interactions.

## Setting Up the Integration

Follow these steps to connect Intercom with your Aikeedo platform:

### Step 1: Create an Intercom Account and Obtain Necessary Credentials

1. If you don't have an Intercom account, [sign up here](https://www.intercom.com/).
2. Once logged in, navigate to the Settings menu in your Intercom dashboard.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Messenger" under the "Channels" section.
4. On the Messenger settings page, click on the "Install" tab.
5. You'll see two important pieces of information here:
   - **Workspace/App ID**: This is displayed at the top of the installation code snippet. It's a string that looks like "abc123de".
   - **Secret Key**: Click on "Copy secret key" to copy your secret key. It's a long string of characters used for identity verification.

<Note>
  The Secret Key is crucial for enabling Identity Verification, which adds an extra layer of security to your integration. Never share this key publicly or commit it to version control systems.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Intercom recommends using Identity Verification to ensure the security and integrity of your user data. Make sure to enable this feature in both Intercom and Aikeedo settings.
</Tip>

6. Copy both the Workspace/App ID and the Secret Keyâ€”you'll need these for configuring Aikeedo.

<Warning>
  Keep your Secret Key confidential. As the Intercom dashboard warns: "Never commit it directly to your repository, client-side code, or anywhere a third party can find it."
</Warning>

### Step 2: Configure Aikeedo

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to Settings.
3. Find and click on "Script Tags" in the Integrations section.
4. Look for the "Intercom" integration option.
5. In the "Config" section, you'll see the following fields:
   - **Status**: A toggle switch to enable or disable the Intercom integration.
   - **Identity verification**: A toggle to enable or disable identity verification.
   - **Workspace/App ID**: Enter your Intercom Workspace/App ID here.
   - **Secret key**: Enter your Intercom Secret Key here (required for identity verification).
6. Toggle the "Status" switch to enable the integration.
7. We recommend enabling "Identity verification" for enhanced security.
8. Enter your Intercom Workspace/App ID in the designated field.
9. If you've enabled identity verification, enter your Intercom Secret Key.
10. Click the "Save changes" button to apply your configuration.

<Check>
  Great job! Intercom is now integrated with your Aikeedo platform.
</Check>

<Note>
  The Secret Key is required to enable Identity Verification, which adds an extra layer of security to your integration.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If you can't find your Workspace/App ID, click the "Click here" link below the ID field for additional guidance.

If you're experiencing issues with your Intercom integration:

1. Verify that you've entered the correct Workspace/App ID in Aikeedo.
2. If using identity verification, ensure your Secret Key is correct and up to date.
3. Check if the Intercom widget appears on your website after enabling the integration.
