## Setting Up the Integration

Follow these simple steps to connect ElevenLabs with your Aikeedo platform:

### Step 1: Obtain Your ElevenLabs API Key

1. If you don't have an ElevenLabs account, [sign up here](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up).
2. Once logged in, navigate to your ElevenLabs dashboard.
3. In the bottom left corner of the page, click on your profile name.
4. In the dropdown menu, select "API Keys" to access your API key management page.
5. On the API Keys page, you'll find your existing API key or options to create a new one.
6. If you don't already have an API key, click on "Create new API key".
7. Copy the generated API keyâ€”you'll need this for Aikeedo.

## Available Models and Tools

Aikeedo leverages a range of ElevenLabs models to power various tools and features:

`eleven_multilingual_v2`, `eleven_turbo_v2_5`, `eleven_multilingual_v1`, `eleven_monolingual_v1`

## Voice Synchronization

Aikeedo synchronizes the available voices from your ElevenLabs account every 4 hours. This means that any new voices added to your ElevenLabs account library may take up to 4 hours to appear in the Aikeedo app.

<Note>
  Only voices available through the ElevenLabs API can be used with Aikeedo. Community-created voices are not available through the API by default. To use community voices, you must first add them to your ElevenLabs account voice library. Once added, they will become available through the voice list API and subsequently in Aikeedo after the next synchronization.
</Note>

## Aikeedo Tools Powered by ElevenLabs

ElevenLabs integration enhances the following Aikeedo tools:

1. **VoiceOver**: Transform text into natural-sounding speech with a wide range of voices and languages.
2. **Voice Isolator**: Separate and enhance voice audio from background noise.

## Best Practices

To make the most of your ElevenLabs integration:

- Experiment with different voices to find the best fit for your use case.
- Use clear and well-formatted text input for optimal text-to-speech results.
- Consider the language and accent requirements of your project when selecting voices.
- Monitor your API usage to manage costs effectively.
- Regularly check your ElevenLabs account for new voices and add desired ones to your library.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the ElevenLabs integration, try these steps:

1. Verify that your API key is correct and active.
2. Check your ElevenLabs account for any usage limits or restrictions.
3. Ensure your Aikeedo platform is up to date.
4. Confirm you have sufficient credit balance in your ElevenLabs account.
5. For model-specific issues, verify that your account has access to the required models.
6. If you don't see newly added voices, remember that synchronization can take up to 4 hours.
7. If you receive error messages related to voice generation or processing, check the ElevenLabs status page for any ongoing service issues.
