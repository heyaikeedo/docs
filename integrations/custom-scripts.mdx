## Introduction

Aikeedo's Custom Scripts feature allows you to add custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to your platform. This powerful functionality enables you to extend the capabilities of your Aikeedo website, integrate additional tools, or customize the appearance and behavior of your site.

## Setting Up Custom Scripts

Follow these steps to add custom scripts to your Aikeedo platform:

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to Settings.
3. Find and click on "Script Tags" in the Integrations section.
4. Look for the "Custom tags" option.

## Configuration Options

In the Custom tags section, you'll see three main areas for adding custom content:

### Head Content

- This is where you can add custom `<meta>` tags, CSS links, or other content that belongs in the `<head>` section of your HTML.
- Content added here will be injected right after the `<head>` tag of your website.

### Body Content

- Use this area to add custom HTML, JavaScript, or other content that you want to appear in the main body of your website.
- Content added here will be injected right after the `<body>` tag of your website.

### Footer Content

- This section is ideal for adding tracking scripts, analytics code, or other content that should appear at the end of your web pages.
- Content added here will be injected right before the closing `</body>` tag of your website.

## Adding Custom Scripts

1. Decide which section (Head, Body, or Footer) is most appropriate for your custom content.
2. Enter your custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript into the corresponding text area.
3. Click the "Save changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply your custom scripts.

## Best Practices

To make the most of the Custom Scripts feature:

- Test your custom scripts thoroughly before adding them to your live site.
- Use the appropriate section for each type of content (e.g., CSS in the Head, JavaScript in the Footer).
- Be cautious when adding third-party scripts, as they can affect your site's performance and security.
- Keep your custom scripts organized and commented for easy maintenance.
- Regularly review and update your custom scripts to ensure they're still necessary and functioning correctly.

<Note>
  Adding custom scripts can potentially break your website's functionality or compromise its security. Only add scripts from trusted sources and that you fully understand.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues after adding custom scripts:

1. Check your browser's console for any JavaScript errors.
2. Verify that your custom HTML is well-formed and doesn't conflict with existing page elements.
3. Ensure that any external resources (like CSS or JavaScript files) are accessible and loading correctly.
4. If your site's functionality is broken, try removing the custom scripts one by one to identify the problematic code.
5. Consider using browser developer tools to debug and test your custom scripts.

<Tip>
  It's a good practice to keep a backup of your original configuration before making significant changes with custom scripts.
