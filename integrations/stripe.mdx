Stripe integration enables secure payment processing and subscription management for your Aikeedo platform. This guide covers account setup, API configuration, and webhook implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [Stripe account](https://stripe.com/)
- Access to your Aikeedo admin panel
- Your domain properly configured with SSL enabled

## Step 1: Set Up Your Stripe Account

If you haven't already, sign up for a Stripe account:

1. Visit the [Stripe website](https://stripe.com/) and click "Start now" or "Create account"
2. Follow the prompts to create and verify your account
3. Complete any additional verification steps required by Stripe

## Step 2: Obtain Stripe API Keys

To connect Aikeedo with Stripe, you'll need to retrieve your API keys:

1. Log in to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Navigate to **Developers** > [**API keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
3. You'll see two types of keys:
   - **Publishable key**: Starts with `pk_`
   - **Secret key**: Starts with `sk_`

<Note>
  Keep your secret key confidential! Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
</Note>

## Step 3: Set Up Stripe Webhooks

Webhooks are crucial for handling recurring payments and keeping your Aikeedo platform in sync with Stripe. Here's how to set them up:

1. In your Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers** > [**Webhooks**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter your webhook URL: `https://your-aikeedo-domain.com/webhooks/stripe`
4. Under "Events to send," select the following:
   - `invoice.created`
   - `invoice.updated`
   - `invoice.finalized`
   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.deleted`
   - `invoice.voided`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
5. Click "Add endpoint" to create the webhook
6. After creation, you'll see a "Signing secret" - copy this for later use

<Tip>
  If you're not sure which events to select, it's safe to choose "Select all events" for comprehensive coverage.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Enable Stripe in Aikeedo

Now that you have your Stripe account set up, it's time to configure Aikeedo:

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel
2. Navigate to **Settings > Payments > Stripe**
3. Toggle the switch to enable Stripe payments
4. Choose the appropriate mode:
   - **Test**: For testing payments (use Stripe's test cards)
   - **Live**: For processing real transactions
5. Enter the following details:
   - **API Publishable Key**: Your Stripe publishable key
   - **API Secret Key**: Your Stripe secret key
   - **Webhook Secret**: The signing secret from your webhook setup
6. Click "Save changes" to apply your settings

  Congratulations! Stripe payments are now enabled on your Aikeedo platform.

## Testing Your Integration

Before going live, it's crucial to test your Stripe integration:

1. Set Aikeedo to "Test" mode
2. Use [Stripe's test card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) to simulate various payment scenarios
3. Create a test subscription or product purchase
4. Verify that payments are processed correctly and webhooks are functioning

Once you're confident everything is working as expected, switch to "Live" mode to start accepting real payments.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your Stripe integration, try these steps:

1. Double-check all API keys and secrets for accuracy
2. Ensure your webhook URL is correct and accessible
3. Review Stripe's dashboard for any error logs or failed webhook attempts
4. Check Aikeedo's error logs for any integration-related issues
