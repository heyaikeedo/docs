## Custom API Keys (BYOK)

Aikeedo supports Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) functionality for Claude AI integration:

- **Workspace-level API keys**: Workspace owners can provide their own Claude AI API key
- **System override**: When configured, the workspace-specific API key takes precedence over the system-wide API key
- **Credit management**: Custom API keys bypass workspace credit deductions for Claude AI services
- **Subscription requirement**: A valid subscription plan and credit balance are still required for other features and API services

<Info>
  BYOK is particularly useful for organizations that want to manage their own
  Claude AI billing and usage directly. For detailed information about BYOK
  configuration and setup, see the [BYOK documentation](/advanced/byok).
