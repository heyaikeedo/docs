## Introduction

Aikeedo's Stability AI integration unlocks advanced image generation capabilities for your platform. With access to Stability AI's cutting-edge models, you can significantly enhance your Imagine tool, allowing users to create unique and high-quality images from text descriptions.

## Setting Up the Integration

Follow these steps to connect Stability AI with your Aikeedo platform:

### Step 1: Obtain Your Stability AI API Key

1. If you don't have a Stability AI account, [sign up here](https://platform.stability.ai/sign-up).
2. Once logged in, click on your profile image in the top right corner of the page.
3. The API Keys page will open automatically. If not, select "API Keys" from the left side menu.
4. On the API Keys page, you'll see a list of your existing API keys.
5. If you don't have any keys, or want to create a new one, click the "+ Create API Key" button in the top right corner of the API Keys section.
6. Once created, you'll see your new API key in the list. The key itself will be partially hidden for security reasons.
7. Use the copy icon next to your API key to copy it to your clipboardâ€”you'll need this for Aikeedo.

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and confidential. It grants access to Stability AI services and should not be shared publicly. Stability AI masks part of the key in the dashboard for security reasons.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure Aikeedo

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > StabilityAI**.
3. In the "API" section, enter your Stability AI API key in the "API Key" field.
4. Click **Save changes** to activate the integration.
