## Introduction

Aikeedo's OneSignal integration enables powerful push notification functionality for your platform. By integrating OneSignal, you can significantly enhance user engagement by sending timely and relevant notifications to your users across various devices.

## Setting Up the Integration

Follow these steps to connect OneSignal with your Aikeedo platform:

### Step 1: Create a OneSignal App and Obtain Your App ID

1. If you don't have a OneSignal account, [sign up here](https://onesignal.com/).
2. Once logged in, click on "All Apps" in the left sidebar.
3. Click the "New App/Website" button to create a new app.
4. Fill in the following details:
   - **OneSignal App Name**: Enter a name for your Aikeedo integration (e.g., "Aikeedo Notifications").
   - **Select your organization**: Choose the appropriate organization from the dropdown.
5. Under "Set up your first channel", select "Web" as we're integrating with a web application.
6. Click "Next: Configure Your Platform" to proceed.
7. On the Web Configuration page, choose "Custom Code" as the integration type.
