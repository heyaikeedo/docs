## Introduction

The OpenAI integration enables access to latest models for chat, content generation, image creation, transcription, and text-to-speech capabilities within your Aikeedo platform.

## Setting Up the Integration

Follow these simple steps to connect OpenAI with your Aikeedo platform:

### Step 1: Obtain Your OpenAI API Key

1. If you don't have an OpenAI account, [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. Once logged in, navigate to the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Click on **Create new secret key**.
4. Copy the generated API keyâ€”you'll need this for Aikeedo.

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure. It provides access to OpenAI's services and should
  not be shared publicly.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure Aikeedo

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > OpenAI**.
3. Paste your OpenAI API key into the **API Secret** field.
4. Configure webhook settings (see Step 3 below).
5. Click **Save Changes** to activate the integration.

<Check>
  Congratulations! OpenAI is now integrated with your Aikeedo platform.
</Check>

### Step 3: Configure Webhooks (Required)

<Warning>
  Webhook configuration is required for OpenAI integration to function properly.
</Warning>

To enable real-time event notifications from OpenAI, you need to configure webhooks:

1. **Set up Webhook URL**: The webhook URL is automatically provided as `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/openai`
2. **Configure OpenAI Dashboard**:
   - Go to your [OpenAI Webhooks Settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/project/webhooks)
   - Create a new webhook endpoint using the provided webhook URL
3. **Set Webhook Secret**:
   - Generate a webhook secret in your OpenAI dashboard
   - Copy the secret and paste it into the **Webhook secret** field in Aikeedo
4. **Select Events**: Ensure the following events are selected in your OpenAI webhook configuration:
   - `video.completed`
   - `video.failed`

<Note>
  Make sure to select all listed events in your OpenAI webhook configuration for
  proper functionality.
</Note>

## Custom API Keys (BYOK)

Aikeedo supports Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) functionality for OpenAI integration:

- **Workspace-level API keys**: Workspace owners can provide their own OpenAI API key
- **System override**: When configured, the workspace-specific API key takes precedence over the system-wide API key
- **Credit management**: Custom API keys bypass workspace credit deductions for OpenAI services
- **Subscription requirement**: A valid subscription plan and credit balance are still required for other features and API services

<Warning>
  **BYOK is not available for features that require OpenAI webhooks.** Models
  such as Sora 2 and Sora 2 Pro always use the system-wide API key because they
  depend on webhook notifications for proper functionality.
</Warning>

<Info>
  BYOK is particularly useful for organizations that want to manage their own
  OpenAI billing and usage directly. For detailed information about BYOK
  configuration and setup, see the [BYOK documentation](/advanced/byok).

## Best Practices

To make the most of your OpenAI integration:

- Experiment with different models to find the best fit for your use case.
- Use clear and specific prompts to get the most accurate results.
- Monitor your API usage to manage costs effectively.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the OpenAI integration, try these steps:

1. **API Key Issues**:

   - Verify that your API key is correct and active
   - Check your OpenAI account for any usage limits or restrictions
   - Confirm you have sufficient credit balance in your OpenAI platform account

2. **Webhook Configuration**:

   - Ensure webhook URL is correctly configured in your OpenAI dashboard
   - Verify that the webhook secret matches between OpenAI and Aikeedo
   - Check that all required events (`video.completed`, `video.failed`) are selected

3. **General Issues**:

   - Ensure your Aikeedo platform is up to date
   - Check network connectivity and firewall settings
   - Verify SSL certificates are valid for webhook endpoints

4. **Model Access Issues**:

   - For model-specific issues, verify that your account has access to the required models
   - If you receive an error message like "The model [model-name] does not exist or you do not have access to it":
     - This error comes directly from OpenAI and indicates that the specific model is not enabled for your account
     - Some models may require specific account tiers or permissions
     - Check which models are accessible to you on the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)
   - Ensure your OpenAI account has sufficient credits and the correct billing setup for the models you're trying to use

5. **BYOK Issues**:
   - If using custom API keys, ensure the workspace-specific key is valid and active
   - Verify that the custom key has the necessary permissions for required models
   - For comprehensive BYOK troubleshooting and configuration details, refer to the [BYOK documentation](/advanced/byok)

<Tip>
  Regularly review your OpenAI usage and available models to ensure smooth
  integration with Aikeedo.

<Note>
  Remember to review OpenAI's usage policies and pricing to ensure compliance
  and manage costs effectively.
