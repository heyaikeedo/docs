4. Confirm you have sufficient credit balance in your OpenAI platform account.
5. If you receive an error message like "The model *01-preview does not exist or you do not have access to it":
   - This error comes directly from OpenAI and indicates that o1 models are not enabled for your account.
   - Currently, o1 models are only available for tier 4 and tier 5 accounts.
   - Check which models are accessible to you on the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).
