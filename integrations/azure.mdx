## Introduction

Aikeedo's Azure integration unlocks advanced text-to-speech capabilities for your platform. With access to Azure's Speech API, you can significantly enhance your VoiceOver tool and audio content creation with high-quality, natural-sounding voices.

## Setting Up the Integration

Follow these steps to connect Microsoft Azure with your Aikeedo platform:

### Step 1: Set Up Azure Speech Service

1. If you don't have an Azure account, [sign up here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
2. Once logged in, access the Azure portal at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
3. Create a new Speech service resource:
   - Click on "Create a resource" in the Azure portal.
   - Search for "Speech" and select "Speech" from the results.
   - Click "Create" to start setting up the Speech service.
   - Fill in the required details:
     - Choose a name for your resource.
     - Select your subscription.
     - Choose a resource group or create a new one.
     - Select a region (this will be your "Location/Region" in Aikeedo).
     - Choose a pricing tier (Free tier is available for testing).
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create" to deploy the Speech service.

4. Once deployment is complete, go to your Speech service resource.
5. In the left menu, under "Resource Management", click on "Keys and Endpoint".
6. You'll find your API key (listed as KEY 1 or KEY 2) and region here. You'll need these for Aikeedo.

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and confidential. It grants access to your Azure services and should not be shared publicly.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure Aikeedo

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Azure Integrations**.
3. In the "Speech API (TTS)" section:
   - Select your "Location/Region" from the dropdown menu.
   - Enter your Azure Speech API key in the "API Key" field.
4. Click **Save changes** to activate the integration.

- Custom voices (if configured in your Azure account)

These voice types offer different levels of quality and naturalness, allowing you to choose the best fit for your specific use case.

## Aikeedo Tools Powered by Azure

Azure integration enhances the following Aikeedo tool:

1. **VoiceOver**: Transform text into high-quality, natural-sounding speech using a wide range of voices and languages.

## Best Practices

To make the most of your Azure integration:

- Experiment with different voice types to find the best fit for your use case.
- Consider the language and accent requirements of your project when selecting voices.
- Monitor your API usage to manage costs effectively.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Azure integration, try these steps:

1. Verify that your API key is correct and active.
2. Ensure you've selected the correct region in Aikeedo that matches your Azure Speech service resource.
3. Check your Azure subscription for any usage limits or restrictions.
4. Confirm you have sufficient credit balance in your Azure account.
5. For voice-specific issues, verify that your account has access to the required voice types.
6. If you receive error messages related to authentication or API calls, double-check your Azure resource configuration.
