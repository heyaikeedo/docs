Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [YooKassa merchant account](https://yookassa.ru/)
- Access to your Aikeedo admin panel

## Step 2: Obtain YooKassa API Credentials

To connect Aikeedo with YooKassa, you'll need to retrieve your API credentials:

### Get Your Shop ID

1. Log in to your [YooKassa Dashboard](https://yookassa.ru/my)

   - It will show your organization name with "ShopID XXXXXXX"

### Get Your API Secret Key

1. In the left sidebar, click on **Интеграция** (Integration)
2. Select **Ключи API** (API Keys) from the integration submenu
3. You'll find your **Секретный ключ** (Secret Key) in the API Keys section

<Warning>
  Keep your Secret Key confidential! Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code. If you lose your key, you can regenerate it using the refresh icon in the dashboard.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Configure YooKassa in Aikeedo

3. **VAT code**: Select the appropriate VAT rate for Russian tax compliance
   - This information is only for the YooKassa receipt

## Testing Your Integration

Before going live, it's crucial to test your YooKassa integration:

1. Set the YooKassa payment gateway to "Test" mode in the Details section
2. Use [YooKassa's test card numbers](https://yookassa.ru/developers/payment-acceptance/testing-and-going-live/testing) to simulate various payment scenarios
3. Create a test subscription or product purchase
4. Verify that payments are processed correctly

<Note>
  YooKassa test environment uses special test card numbers and doesn't process real payments. Always test thoroughly before switching to live mode.
</Note>

1. **Verify API Credentials**: Double-check your Shop ID and Secret Key in the Keys section

3. **Verify Currency**: Make sure your selected currency is supported by YooKassa
4. **Test Payments**: Use YooKassa's test card numbers to verify the integration works correctly
