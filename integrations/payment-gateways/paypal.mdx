PayPal integration enables secure payment processing and subscription management for your Aikeedo platform. This guide covers account setup, API configuration, and webhook implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [PayPal Business account](https://www.paypal.com/us/business)
- Access to your Aikeedo admin panel
- Your domain properly configured with SSL enabled

## Step 1: Set Up Your PayPal Business Account

If you haven't already, sign up for a PayPal Business account:

1. Visit the [PayPal Business website](https://www.paypal.com/us/business) and click "Sign Up"
2. Follow the prompts to create and verify your business account
3. Complete any additional verification steps required by PayPal

## Step 2: Obtain PayPal API Credentials

To connect Aikeedo with PayPal, you'll need to retrieve your API credentials:

1. Log in to the [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/)
2. Navigate to **Apps & Credentials**
3. Click on **Create App** to generate a new app for your integration
4. Set the following details:
   - App Name: Choose a name for your integration (e.g., "Aikeedo Payments")
   - Select "Merchant" as the app type
5. Click "Create App"
6. On the next page, you'll find your **Client ID** and can generate a **Secret Key**

<Note>
  Keep your Secret Key confidential! Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
</Note>

## Step 3: Set Up PayPal Webhooks

Webhooks are crucial for handling recurring payments and keeping your Aikeedo platform in sync with PayPal. Here's how to set them up:

1. In the PayPal Developer Dashboard, go to your app's details page
2. Scroll down to the **Webhooks** section and click "Add Webhook"
3. Enter your webhook URL: `https://your-aikeedo-domain.com/webhooks/paypal`
4. Select the following events:
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.CANCELLED`
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.CREATED`
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.PAID`
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.REFUNDED`
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.SCHEDULED`
   - `INVOICING.INVOICE.UPDATED`
   - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`
5. Click "Save" to create the webhook
6. After creation, you'll see a "Webhook ID" - copy this for later use

<Tip>
  If you're not sure which events to select, it's safe to choose all relevant billing and invoicing events for comprehensive coverage.

## Testing Your Integration

Before going live, it's crucial to test your PayPal integration:

1. Set Aikeedo to "Sandbox" mode
2. Use [PayPal's sandbox accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/tools/sandbox/accounts/) to simulate various payment scenarios
3. Create a test subscription or product purchase
4. Verify that payments are processed correctly and webhooks are functioning

Once you're confident everything is working as expected, switch to "Live" mode to start accepting real payments.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your PayPal integration, try these steps:

1. Double-check all API credentials and Webhook ID for accuracy
2. Ensure your webhook URL is correct and accessible
3. Review PayPal's developer dashboard for any error logs or failed webhook attempts
4. Check Aikeedo's error logs for any integration-related issues
