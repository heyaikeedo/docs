Bank Transfer is a built-in payment method in Aikeedo that allows customers to pay via direct bank transfers. This payment option supports both domestic and international transfers with comprehensive bank details configuration.

## Overview

Bank Transfer payments provide an alternative to online payment gateways, allowing customers to transfer funds directly to your business bank account. This method is particularly useful for:

- High-value transactions
- B2B payments
- Customers who prefer traditional banking methods
- Regions with limited online payment gateway support

<Note>
Bank Transfer is a built-in payment method and doesn't require additional plugins or external service setup.
