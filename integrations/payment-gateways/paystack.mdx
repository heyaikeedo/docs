Paystack integration enables secure payment processing and subscription management for your Aikeedo platform, specifically designed for African markets. This guide covers account setup and API configuration.

<Note>
  Paystack integration is available as a separate plugin that must be purchased from the [Aikeedo Marketplace](https://aikeedo.com/marketplace/) before you can configure this payment gateway.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [Paystack merchant account](https://paystack.com/)
- Access to your Aikeedo admin panel
- Your domain properly configured with SSL enabled
- A valid business registration in supported African countries

## Step 1: Set Up Your Paystack Account

If you haven't already, sign up for a Paystack merchant account:

1. Visit the [Paystack website](https://paystack.com/) and click "Create a free account"
2. Follow the prompts to create and verify your merchant account
3. Complete the business verification process with required documents
4. Wait for account approval (typically 1-2 business days)

<Note>
  Paystack requires business registration in supported African countries. Personal accounts are not supported for merchant services.
</Note>

## Step 2: Obtain Paystack API Credentials

To connect Aikeedo with Paystack, you'll need to retrieve your API credentials:

1. Log in to your [Paystack Dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys & Webhooks**
3. You'll find your credentials:
   - **Public Key**: Starts with `pk_test_` (test) or `pk_live_` (live)
   - **Secret Key**: Starts with `sk_test_` (test) or `sk_live_` (live)

<Warning>
  Keep your Secret Key confidential! Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Configure Paystack in Aikeedo

Now that you have your Paystack account set up, configure the integration in Aikeedo:

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel
2. Navigate to **Settings > Payments** page
3. Click on **Paystack**

### Details Section

Configure the general settings:

1. **Status**: Toggle the switch to enable Paystack payments
2. **Charge Currency**: Select your preferred currency
   - **Inherit**: Use your platform's default currency
   - **Nigerian Naira (NGN)**: Default for Nigeria
   - **Ghanaian Cedi (GHS)**: For Ghana
   - **Kenyan Shilling (KES)**: For Kenya
   - **South African Rand (ZAR)**: For South Africa
   - **US Dollar (USD)**: International transactions
   - If you select a currency different from your default and have a currency rate provider set up, amounts will be automatically converted
3. **Mode**: Choose between:
   - **Test**: For testing payments with Paystack's test environment
   - **Live**: For processing real transactions

### Keys Section

Enter your API credentials:

1. **API public key**: Enter your Paystack public key (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode or `pk_live_` for live mode)
2. **API secret key**: Enter your Paystack secret key (starts with `sk_test_` for test mode or `sk_live_` for live mode)
3. Click **Save changes** to apply your settings

### Webhooks Section

Configure webhook notifications:

1. **Webhook URL**: The webhook URL is automatically set to `{your_domain}/webhooks/paystack`
2. Copy this URL and add it to your Paystack Dashboard:
   - Go to **Settings** > **API Keys & Webhooks** in your Paystack Dashboard
   - Enter the webhook URL in the **Test Webhook URL** field (or **Live Webhook URL** for production)
   - Click **Save changes** in your Paystack Dashboard

<Note>
  The webhook URL will automatically handle all necessary payment events including successful payments, failed payments, and subscription updates. No additional configuration is required in Aikeedo.
</Note>

<Check>
  Congratulations! Paystack payments are now enabled on your Aikeedo platform.
</Check>

## Testing Your Integration

Before going live, it's crucial to test your Paystack integration:

1. Set the Paystack payment gateway to "Test" mode in the Details section
2. Use [Paystack's test card numbers](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/test-payments) to simulate various payment scenarios:
3. Create a test subscription or product purchase
4. Verify that payments are processed correctly

<Note>
  Paystack test environment uses special test card numbers and doesn't process real payments. Always test thoroughly before switching to live mode.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your Paystack integration, try these steps:

1. **Verify API Credentials**: Double-check your API Public Key and Secret Key in the Keys section
2. **Check Mode Setting**: Ensure you're using Test mode for testing and Live mode for production
3. **Verify Currency**: Make sure your selected currency is supported by Paystack
4. **Test Payments**: Use Paystack's test card numbers to verify the integration works correctly
5. **Check Webhook Configuration**: Ensure your webhook URL is properly configured in both Aikeedo and Paystack
