Razorpay enables secure payments and subscriptions for the Indian market. This guide shows you how to fetch keys from Razorpay and paste them into Aikeedo.

<Note>
  Razorpay is available as a ready‑to‑use plugin in Aikeedo. You only need to copy keys and configure webhooks.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [Razorpay merchant account](https://razorpay.com/)
- Access to your Aikeedo admin panel
- Your domain using HTTPS (valid SSL certificate)
- Business eligibility for accepting payments in India

## Step 1: Set up your Razorpay account

If you are new to Razorpay:

1. Visit the [Razorpay website](https://razorpay.com/) and click Sign Up”.
2. Complete onboarding and KYC verification.
3. Wait for account approval (usually 1–2 business days).

## Step 2: Get your API keys in Razorpay

1. Log in to the [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/).
2. Select the mode at the top: **Test** or **Live**.
3. Go to **Account & Settings → API Keys** and click **Generate Key** for the selected mode.
4. Copy the following from the pop‑up:
   - **Key Id** (starts with `rzp_test_` in Test or `rzp_live_` in Live)
   - **Key Secret** (shown once when generated)

<Warning>
  Keep your Key Secret confidential. It is shown only once on generation; store it securely.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Generating **Live** keys may require your website/app details to be verified in Razorpay. Only users with Owner or Admin role can access API Keys. See Razorpay’s guide: [API Keys](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys/).
</Info>

## Step 3: Configure required Razorpay settings for subscriptions

These settings are mandatory when you sell subscriptions:

- **Enable Flash Checkout** in your Razorpay Dashboard. See Razorpay’s docs: [Subscriptions – Flash Checkout](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/subscriptions/#flash-checkout).
- **Fee bearer model** must be set to **You pay the fees**. The “Convenience fee model” is not supported for subscriptions. See Razorpay’s guide: [Configuration – Fee bearer model](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/configuration/#manage-fee-bearer-model).

<Warning>
  Without these settings, subscription payments will fail.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Create a webhook in Razorpay

1. In the Razorpay Dashboard, go to **Accounts & Settings → Webhooks**.
2. Click **Add New Webhook**.
3. Set the Webhook URL to your site URL followed by `/webhooks/razorpay`, for example: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/razorpay`.
4. Select **All events**.
5. Set a **Webhook secret** (any random string). Copy it—you will paste the same value into Aikeedo.
6. Save the webhook.

<Tip>
  The webhook secret must match exactly in Razorpay and in Aikeedo.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Enable Razorpay in Aikeedo

Open the Aikeedo admin and go to **Payments → Razorpay**. Fill in the sections as shown in the Aikeedo dashboard screenshot.

### Details section

1. **Status**: Enable the toggle to turn on Razorpay.
2. **Charge Currency**: Choose your billing currency. If you use a currency different from your default currency and have a currency rate provider configured, amounts are converted automatically.
3. **Mode**: Choose **Test** for testing or **Live** for real payments.

<Info>
  For subscriptions, ensure Flash Checkout is enabled and Fee bearer is set to “You pay the fees” in Razorpay, as noted above.
</Info>

### Keys section

1. **API Key Id**: Paste the value from Razorpay.
2. **API Key Secret**: Paste the secret from Razorpay.

### Webhooks section

1. **Webhook URL**: This is shown in the Aikeedo UI. Create the same URL in Razorpay.
2. **Webhook secret**: Paste the exact secret you set in Razorpay.
3. Click **Save changes**.

<Check>
  Razorpay is now connected. You can accept payments and create subscriptions.
</Check>

## Testing your integration

1. Set **Mode** to **Test** in Aikeedo and use your Razorpay Test keys.
2. Make a test purchase or subscription using Razorpay’s test methods: [Test Card Details](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/payments/test-card-details/).
3. Confirm you see payment updates in Aikeedo and in the Razorpay Dashboard.

<Note>
  The test environment does not move real funds. Switch to Live mode only after successful tests.
</Note>
