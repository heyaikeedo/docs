Cryptomus integration enables secure cryptocurrency payment processing for your Aikeedo platform, supporting various digital currencies and blockchain networks. This guide covers account setup and API configuration.

<Note>
  Cryptomus integration is available as a separate plugin that must be purchased from the [Aikeedo Marketplace](https://aikeedo.com/marketplace/) before you can configure this payment gateway.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An active [Cryptomus merchant account](https://cryptomus.com/gateway)
- Access to your Aikeedo admin panel
- Your domain properly configured with SSL enabled
- A verified business entity

## Step 1: Set Up Your Cryptomus Account

If you haven't already, sign up for a Cryptomus merchant account:

1. Visit the [Cryptomus website](https://cryptomus.com/gateway) and click "Get Started"
2. Register using your email or phone number
3. Create a merchant account for payment processing
4. Complete the business verification process
5. Wait for account approval and moderation

<Note>
  Cryptomus requires domain verification to ensure the legitimacy of your platform. This can be done through DNS records, meta tags, or HTML file upload.
</Note>

## Step 2: Obtain Cryptomus API Credentials

To connect Aikeedo with Cryptomus, you'll need to retrieve your API credentials:

1. Log in to your [Cryptomus Dashboard](https://cryptomus.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Business** > **Merchants**
3. Select your project and click **Merchant Settings**
4. In the **API Integration** section, you'll find your credentials:
   - **Merchant ID**: Your unique merchant identifier (e.g., `1bd8163d-92e0-4c1d-9452-5b4dc212f307`)
   - **Payment API Key**: Your API key for payment operations (e.g., `Dgke********3stU`)

<Warning>
  Keep your Payment API Key confidential! Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Pass KYB Verification and Domain Verification

Before you can process payments, you need to pass Cryptomus verification:

1. **KYB (Know Your Business) Verification**: 
   - Click "Pass KYB" in your merchant settings
   - Provide required business documents and information
   - This ensures your safety by preventing fraud in financial transactions
2. **Domain Verification**: Choose one of these methods:
   - **DNS Record**: Add a TXT record to your domain
   - **Meta Tag**: Insert a meta tag in your website's head section
   - **HTML File**: Upload an HTML file to your website root
3. **Wait for Approval**: Cryptomus will review your application

<Note>
  Both KYB verification and domain verification are mandatory for security and compliance purposes. Without them, your merchant account cannot process payments.
</Note>

## Step 3: Configure Cryptomus in Aikeedo

Now that you have your Cryptomus account set up, configure the integration in Aikeedo:

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel
2. Navigate to **Payments** in the main menu
3. Click on **Cryptomus**

3. **Enabled for** (required field):

## Testing Your Integration

Before going live, it's crucial to test your Cryptomus integration:

1. Create test plans with small prices to verify payment processing
2. Test different cryptocurrency networks
3. Test payment confirmation and order updates

<Warning>
  Always test thoroughly with small amounts before processing larger payments. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible.
</Warning>


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with your Cryptomus integration, try these steps:

1. **Verify API Credentials**: Double-check your Merchant ID and Payment API Key in the Keys section
2. **Check KYB Verification**: Ensure your merchant account has passed KYB verification in the merchant settings
