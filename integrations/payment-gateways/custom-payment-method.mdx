## Prerequisites

Before configuring manual payment methods, ensure you have:

- Clear payment instructions for your customers
- Any supporting documentation or files ready for upload
- A defined process for verifying custom payments
- Customer support procedures for payment-related inquiries

## Configuration

### Accessing Manual Payment Settings

1. Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel
2. Navigate to **Settings > Payments > Manual Payment** (or **Settings > Payments > [Your Method Name]** if already configured)

<Note>
The navigation path changes based on configuration status:
- **Before configuration**: **Settings > Payments > Manual Payment**
- **After configuration**: **Settings > Payments > [Your Method Name]** (where [Your Method Name] is the method name you've defined)
</Note>

### Basic Configuration

Configure the fundamental settings for your custom payment method:

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Custom Payment Method">

  - One-time and annual payments
  - All payments
</Step>

<Step title="Set Payment Method">
  Choose **One time payments (Recommended)** from the dropdown for standard custom payment processing.

  - Include all necessary details for payment completion
