Iyzico enables secure card payments and subscriptions in Turkey. This guide shows how to configure the ready‑to‑use plugin in Aikeedo using your Iyzico dashboard. No code is needed.

<Note>
  Subscription management (Abonelik Yönetimi) is provided by Iyzico as an add‑on. To use subscriptions, enable it from the <strong>Eklentiler</strong> section in your Iyzico dashboard. Learn more: [Iyzico Abonelik](https://docs.iyzico.com/urunler/abonelik).
 </Note>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- An active [Iyzico merchant account](https://www.iyzico.com/)
- Access to your Aikeedo admin panel
- Your domain with SSL (HTTPS)
- A business registered in Turkey (required by Iyzico)

## Step 1: Get your Iyzico API keys

From the Iyzico dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Iyzico Merchant Panel](https://merchant.iyzipay.com/login) or Sandbox panel if testing.
2. Go to **Ayarlar > Firma Ayarları** (Settings > Merchant Settings).
3. In the **API Anahtarları** card you will see:
   - **API Anahtarı** (API Key) — public key
   - **Güvenlik Anahtarı** (Secret Key)
4. Copy both values. You will paste them into Aikeedo.

<Warning>
  Keep your Secret Key confidential. Do not share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Configure Iyzico in Aikeedo

1. In Aikeedo, open **Payments** and click **Iyzico**.
2. In the **Details** section:
   - **Status**: Enable to turn on Iyzico.
   - **Charge Currency**: Choose the currency to charge customers. Options include: Turkish Lira (TRY), US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), Norwegian Krone (NOK), Russian Ruble (RUB), Swiss Franc (CHF), or **Inherit** to use your default.
   - **Mode**: Select **Sandbox** for testing or **Live** for production.
3. In the **Keys** section (Sandbox or Live tab):
   - **API public key**: paste your Iyzico API Key.
   - **Secret key**: paste your Iyzico Secret Key.
4. In the **Webhooks** card, Aikeedo shows your read‑only webhook URL.
   - Copy this URL; you will paste it into the Iyzico dashboard in the next step.
5. Click **Save changes**.

<Check>
  Iyzico is now connected. New payments will be processed through Iyzico according to your selected mode and currency.
</Check>

## Step 3: Add webhook URLs in Iyzico

To receive payment and subscription notifications from Iyzico:

1. In the Iyzico dashboard, open **Ayarlar > Firma Ayarları**.
2. In **İşyeri Bildirimleri** (Merchant Notifications), enable notifications and paste the webhook URL you copied from Aikeedo into the **İşyeri Bildirimleri Url** field.
3. If you use subscriptions, in **İşyeri Abonelik Ödeme Bildirimleri** enable both toggles and paste the same webhook URL into:
   - **Başarılı Abonelik Bildirimleri Url**
   - **Başarısız Abonelik Bildirimleri Url**
4. Save changes in the Iyzico dashboard.

<Tip>
  Using the same single webhook URL for all merchant and subscription events is recommended. Aikeedo routes events automatically.
</Tip>

## Testing

To test without real charges:

1. In Aikeedo, set **Mode** to **Test**.
2. Log in to the [Iyzico Sandbox](https://sandbox-merchant.iyzipay.com/).
3. Use Iyzico test cards to perform a payment or a subscription: [Test Kartları](https://docs.iyzico.com/ek-bilgiler/test-kartlari).
4. Check that the transaction appears in Aikeedo and that webhooks are received.

<Note>
  Sandbox uses test cards and does not move money. Switch to Live only after successful tests.
</Note>

## Going live

1. Replace Sandbox keys in Aikeedo with your Live **API Key** and **Secret Key** from Iyzico.
2. Ensure **İşyeri Bildirimleri** and (if applicable) **Abonelik Ödeme Bildirimleri** point to your production domain.
3. Change **Mode** to **Live** and save.
