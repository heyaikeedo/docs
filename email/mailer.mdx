Proper email configuration is crucial for maintaining smooth communication between your Aikeedo platform and its users. This guide will help you set up and customize your mailer settings to ensure reliable email delivery.

## Understanding Mailer Settings

Before diving into the configuration process, it's important to understand the key components of Aikeedo's mailer system.

### Mailer Transports

Aikeedo supports two types of mailer transports:

1. **Null Transport (Default)**
   - This option ignores sending emails, making it useful for testing purposes.
   - No actual emails are sent when this transport is selected.

2. **SMTP Transport**
   - Sends emails using an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server.
   - Requires additional configuration of SMTP settings.

<Note>
  If you choose the SMTP Transport, make sure to configure your SMTP settings first. You can find detailed instructions in our [SMTP Configuration Guide](/email/smtp).
</Note>

### Sender Details

Two important fields define how your emails appear to recipients:

- **Sender Email**: The email address that will be used as the sender for all system emails.
- **Sender Name**: The name that will appear as the sender for all system emails.

## Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

Follow these steps to set up your mailer in Aikeedo:

### 1. Access the Admin Panel

To access the mailer configuration in Aikeedo, log in to the admin panel using your administrator credentials. Once logged in, navigate to Settings > Email > Mail. This will take you to the mailer configuration page where you can adjust your email settings.

### 2. Configure Mailer Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Select Mailer Transport">
    1. In the "General" section, find the "Mailer transport" dropdown menu.
    2. Choose between "Null Transport" (for testing) or "SMTP Transport" (for actual email sending).
    
    <Warning>
      If you select "SMTP Transport", ensure you have properly configured your SMTP settings beforehand.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Sender Details">
    1. Locate the "Sender details" section.
    2. Enter the desired email address in the "Sender email" field (e.g., noreply@yourdomain.com).
    3. Specify the name you want recipients to see in the "Sender name" field (e.g., "Aikeedo Support").
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Save Your Configuration

After entering all the necessary information:

1. Review your settings to ensure accuracy.
2. Click the "Save changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply your new mail configuration.

<Check>
  Your mailer is now configured! Aikeedo will use these settings for all system-generated emails.
</Check>

## Testing Your Configuration

It's always a good idea to test your email configuration to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. Set up a test user account or use an existing one.
2. Trigger an email-sending action (e.g., password reset, welcome email).
3. Check the receiving inbox to confirm the email was sent and received correctly.

<Tip>
  If you're using the Null Transport for testing, remember that no actual emails will be sent. You may need to check your application logs or use a debugging tool to verify the email sending process.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with email delivery:

- Double-check your SMTP settings if using SMTP Transport.
- Verify that your sender email is correctly formatted and from a valid domain.
- Check your server's firewall settings to ensure it's not blocking outgoing SMTP traffic.
- Consider using a dedicated email service provider for improved deliverability.

By carefully configuring your mailer settings, you ensure that your Aikeedo platform can effectively communicate with users, enhancing their experience and keeping them informed about important updates and actions.
