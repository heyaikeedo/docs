Proper email configuration ensures reliable delivery of system notifications, password resets, and user communications. This guide covers mailer transport setup and sender configuration.

## Understanding Mailer Settings

Before diving into the configuration process, it's important to understand the key components of Aikeedo's mailer system.

### Mailer Transports

Aikeedo supports two types of mailer transports:

1. **Null Transport (Default)**
   - This option ignores sending emails, making it useful for testing purposes.
   - No actual emails are sent when this transport is selected.

2. **SMTP Transport**
   - Sends emails using an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server.
   - Requires additional configuration of SMTP settings.

<Note>
  If you choose the SMTP Transport, make sure to configure your SMTP settings first. You can find detailed instructions in our [SMTP Configuration Guide](/email/smtp).
</Note>

### Sender Details

Two important fields define how your emails appear to recipients:

- **Sender Email**: The email address that will be used as the sender for all system emails.
- **Sender Name**: The name that will appear as the sender for all system emails.

## Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

Follow these steps to set up your mailer in Aikeedo:

### 1. Access the Admin Panel

To access the mailer configuration in Aikeedo, log in to the admin panel using your administrator credentials. Once logged in, navigate to Settings > Email > Mail. This will take you to the mailer configuration page where you can adjust your email settings.

### 2. Configure Mailer Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Select Mailer Transport">
    1. In the "General" section, find the "Mailer transport" dropdown menu.
    2. Choose between "Null Transport" (for testing) or "SMTP Transport" (for actual email sending).
    
    <Warning>
      If you select "SMTP Transport", ensure you have properly configured your SMTP settings beforehand.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Sender Details">
    1. Locate the "Sender details" section.
    2. Enter the desired email address in the "Sender email" field (e.g., noreply@yourdomain.com).
    3. Specify the name you want recipients to see in the "Sender name" field (e.g., "Aikeedo Support").
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Save Your Configuration

After entering all the necessary information:

1. Review your settings to ensure accuracy.
2. Click the "Save changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply your new mail configuration.

<Check>
  Your mailer is now configured! Aikeedo will use these settings for all system-generated emails.
</Check>

## Testing Your Configuration

It's always a good idea to test your email configuration to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. Set up a test user account or use an existing one.
2. Trigger an email-sending action (e.g., password reset, welcome email).
3. Check the receiving inbox to confirm the email was sent and received correctly.

<Tip>
  If you're using the Null Transport for testing, remember that no actual emails will be sent. You may need to check your application logs or use a debugging tool to verify the email sending process.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with email delivery:

- Verify your SMTP settings if using SMTP Transport
- Ensure your sender email is correctly formatted and from a valid domain
- Check server firewall settings for outgoing SMTP traffic
- Consider using a dedicated email service provider for improved deliverability
- Review server logs for detailed error messages

For advanced configuration, refer to our [SMTP Configuration Guide](/email/smtp).
