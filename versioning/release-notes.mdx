## Migration Guide: Upgrading from v2.x to v3.0

<Warning>
  Version 3.0 is a major release with breaking changes. A standard update is NOT sufficient for upgrading from v2.x to v3.0. Please follow this migration guide to avoid data loss.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Take a Backup">
    Before starting the migration, create a full backup of your database and all files in your current Aikeedo installation.
    <Note>
      This is essential to prevent data loss. Make sure your backup includes user uploads and your database.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Old Files">
    Delete all files and folders from your installation directory.
    <Warning>
      This will remove all application files. Do not proceed unless you have a backup.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Database Details">
    Before installing the new version, ensure you have your previous database name and user credentials ready. You will need to enter these during installation to preserve your data.
    When prompted by the installer, choose the <b>Migrate</b> option to keep your current data.
    <Note>
      If you provide the same database details as your previous installation, the installer will ask whether you want to migrate your current data or perform a fresh install. <b>Choose the <i>Migrate</i> option</b> to preserve your data. Only choose a fresh install if you want to start with a clean database.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the New Version">
    Install the new version in the same directory by extracting to the same location as your previous installation. Then follow the <a href="/setup/installation">installation guide</a> to complete the setup.
    <Tip>
      The new version package includes all required files and directories. Overwrite any existing files if prompted.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restore Uploads">
    After installation is complete, restore your <code>/public/uploads</code> directory from your backup.
    <Tip>
      If you are using <code>public_html</code> instead of <code>public</code>, restore your uploaded files from your backup to <code>/public_html/uploads</code>.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalize Update in Admin">
    Navigate to the <b>Update</b> page in the Admin panel. This step is crucial as it finalizes the update process in the background.
    <Warning>
      Do not skip this step. The update will not be fully applied until you visit the update page in Admin.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reinstall Plugins">
    Install your plugins again from the admin UI.
    <Note>
      Plugin architecture has changed in v3.0. All plugins must be reinstalled manually.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you have custom plugins or integrations, review the breaking changes above and update your code as needed.
