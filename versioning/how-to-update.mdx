<Warning>
  <b>Upgrading from v2.x to v3.0?</b> This guide is <u>not</u> suitable for major version upgrades. To upgrade from v2.x to v3.0, you must follow the dedicated <a href="/versioning/release-notes#migration-guide-upgrading-from-v2-x-to-v3-0">Migration Guide</a> instead. Attempting to use the standard update process may result in data loss or a broken installation.
</Warning>

  The migration guide is required for all major version upgrades (e.g., v2.x to v3.0). Use this update guide only for minor or patch updates within the same major version.
</Note>

## Before You Begin

Before initiating the update process, it's crucial to take a few preparatory steps:

1. **Check for Updates**: Visit our [official website](https://aikeedo.com) to confirm the latest available version of Aikeedo.

2. **Review the Changelog**: Familiarize yourself with the new features, improvements, and any potential breaking changes by reviewing our [changelog](https://aikeedo.com/changelog/).

3. **Backup Your Data**: As a precautionary measure, create a complete backup of your Aikeedo data. This step is crucial to prevent any potential data loss during the update process.

<Note>
  Always perform updates in a staging environment first, if possible, to ensure compatibility with your specific setup.

## Update Process

Follow these steps to update your Aikeedo installation:

1. **Download the Latest Version**:
   - Obtain the latest Aikeedo package from the official source.
   - Extract the downloaded zip file on your local machine.

2. **Locate the Update File**:
   - Find the `aikeedo-server-files.zip` file within the extracted contents.

3. **Access the Admin Panel**:
   - Log in to your Aikeedo admin panel.
   - Navigate to the "Update" page in the admin dashboard.

4. **Upload the Update File**:
   - Click on the "Choose File" button.
   - Select the `aikeedo-server-files.zip` file you located earlier.

5. **Initiate the Update**:
   - Click the "Install" button to begin the update process.
   - Follow any on-screen instructions carefully.

<Warning>
  The update process may take several minutes to complete. Do not close your browser or interrupt the process until it's finished.
</Warning>

6. **Special Step for cPanel Users**:
   If your installation environment requires the web root directory to be `public_html` instead of `public` (common in cPanel installations for the main domain), you'll need to take an additional manual step:

   - Copy all files from the `public` directory to the `public_html` directory.
   - Make sure to include hidden files and folders (such as `.htaccess` file or `.vite` directory).
   - If necessary, enable the option to view hidden files in your file manager.

<Note>
  This step is crucial for ensuring all required files are in the correct location. Failing to copy hidden files may result in functionality issues.
</Note>

## Post-Update Steps

After the update process completes:

1. **Verify the Update**: Confirm that the update was successful by checking the version number in your admin panel.

2. **Clear Cache**: In most cases, this step is not necessary. Aikeedo automatically manages its cache during updates. However, if you notice any display issues, you may want to clear your browser cache as a troubleshooting step.

3. **Test Functionality**: Thoroughly test all aspects of your Aikeedo installation, including:
   - User authentication
   - AI-powered features
   - Payment integrations (if applicable)
   - Custom configurations or integrations

4. **Review Settings**: Some updates may introduce new settings or change existing ones. Review your configuration to ensure everything is set up as desired.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during or after the update:

1. Review the update logs (if available) for any error messages.
2. Ensure all [server requirements](/get-started/server-requirements) are still met after the update.
3. If problems persist, don't hesitate to [contact our support team](mailto:support@aikeedo.com) for assistance.
