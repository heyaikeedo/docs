CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a crucial tool for protecting your Aikeedo application from spam and automated abuse. This guide focuses on setting up and configuring Google reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible, which is currently the supported CAPTCHA solution for Aikeedo.

## Current CAPTCHA Support

At present, Aikeedo supports Google reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible. This powerful and user-friendly CAPTCHA solution offers robust protection without disrupting the user experience.

<Note>
  While only Google reCAPTCHA is currently supported, Aikeedo may introduce additional CAPTCHA options in future updates. Stay tuned to our [changelog](https://aikeedo.com/changelog/) for the latest feature additions.

## What is Google reCAPTCHA?

Google reCAPTCHA is a free service that helps protect websites from spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible uses advanced risk analysis techniques to distinguish between humans and bots without requiring users to solve puzzles or click checkboxes.

## Benefits of Using reCAPTCHA

- **Enhanced Security**: Safeguard your forms and user interactions from spam bots and malicious attacks.
- **Flexible Security Settings**: Adjust protection levels based on your specific requirements and risk tolerance.

## Setting Up Google reCAPTCHA

To integrate Google reCAPTCHA with your Aikeedo application:

1. **Register for reCAPTCHA**:
   - Go to the [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).
   - Log in with your Google account.
   - Click the "+" button to add a new site.

2. **Configure reCAPTCHA settings**:
   - Enter a label for your site (e.g., your domain name) in the "Label" field.
   - For "reCAPTCHA type", select "Challenge (v2)".
   - Under the Challenge (v2) option, choose "Invisible reCAPTCHA badge".
   - In the "Domains" section, add your Aikeedo application's domain(s).
   - Under "Google Cloud Platform", you may see a project name if you've used Google Cloud before. If not, a new project will be created for you.

<Note>
  Aikeedo is designed to work with the "Invisible reCAPTCHA badge" option. This provides security without disrupting the user experience.
</Note>

3. **Complete the registration**:
   - Review your settings to ensure everything is correct.
   - Click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the page.

4. **Retrieve your Site Key and Secret Key**:
   - After submitting, you'll be provided with a Site Key and a Secret Key.
   - Keep these keys secure, as you'll need them to configure reCAPTCHA in Aikeedo.

<Warning>
  Never share your Secret Key publicly or include it in client-side code. Keep it confidential to maintain the security of your CAPTCHA implementation.
</Warning>

## Configuring CAPTCHA in Aikeedo

Once you have your reCAPTCHA keys, enable and configure it in Aikeedo:

1. Access the Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "User accounts" > "CAPTCHA".
3. Toggle on "Protect with Google reCAPTCHA".
4. Input your Site Key in the "Site key" field.
5. Enter your Secret Key in the "Secret key" field.
6. Click "Save changes" to apply the configuration.

<Warning>
  Never share your Secret Key publicly or include it in client-side code. Keep it confidential to maintain the security of your CAPTCHA implementation.
</Warning>

## Testing Your CAPTCHA Integration

After setting up CAPTCHA, it's crucial to test its functionality:

1. Open a new incognito/private browsing window or use a different browser.
2. Navigate to your Aikeedo platform's public-facing pages.
3. Attempt actions that should be protected, such as user registration or login.
4. Confirm that the reCAPTCHA challenge activates when appropriate.

<Note>
  It's important to test CAPTCHA integration without logging out of your admin account to avoid potential login issues. Using a separate browsing session ensures you can always access the admin panel if needed.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your CAPTCHA integration, consider these steps:

- Verify that your Site Key and Secret Key are correctly entered in the Aikeedo settings.
- Ensure your domain is properly listed in the Google reCAPTCHA admin console.
- Check your browser console for any JavaScript errors related to reCAPTCHA.
- Confirm that your server can communicate with Google's reCAPTCHA API servers.
