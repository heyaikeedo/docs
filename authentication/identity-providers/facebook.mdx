## Overview

Integrating Facebook as an identity provider offers your users a convenient and secure way to access your Aikeedo application. This feature leverages Facebook's OAuth 2.0 protocol, ensuring a streamlined authentication process while maintaining high security standards.

<Note>
Before you begin, ensure you have admin access to your Aikeedo application and a Facebook Developer account for setting up the OAuth integration.
</Note>

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Create a Facebook App

1. Visit the [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) website.
2. Click on "My Apps" in the top-right corner.
3. Select "Create App" and choose the app type that best fits your needs (e.g., "Consumer" or "Business").
4. Follow the prompts to set up your app, providing the necessary information.

### 2. Configure Facebook Login

1. In your app's dashboard, navigate to the "Add a Product" section.
2. Find "Facebook Login" and click "Set Up".
3. Choose "Web" as the platform for your app.
4. Enter your website's URL in the "Site URL" field.
5. Click "Save" and then "Continue".

### 3. Set Up OAuth Settings

1. In the left sidebar, click on "Facebook Login" > "Settings".
2. In the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" field, enter the callback URL provided by Aikeedo.

<Tip>
Look for a click-to-copy feature in Aikeedo for easy access to the correct callback URL.
</Tip>

<Warning>
The callback URL is automatically generated based on your Site Domain and SSL settings. To configure these, visit the [Website Essentials](/website-basics/essentials) page in your Aikeedo admin panel.
</Warning>

3. Scroll down and click "Save Changes".

### 4. Obtain App ID and App Secret

1. In the left sidebar, click on "Settings" > "Basic".
2. Here you'll find your "App ID" and "App Secret". You'll need these for Aikeedo configuration.

<Note>
Keep your App Secret confidential. Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
</Note>

### 5. Configure Aikeedo

1. Log into your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Identity providers > Facebook**.
3. Toggle the switch to enable "Login with Facebook".
4. Enter the "App ID" and "App Secret" obtained from your Facebook App.
5. Click "Save changes" to apply your configuration.  

## Testing Your Integration

After completing the setup, it's crucial to test the integration to ensure a smooth user experience:

1. Log out of your Aikeedo application.
2. On the login page, look for the "Login with Facebook" option.
3. Click the option and proceed through the Facebook authentication flow.
4. Verify that you can successfully log in and access your Aikeedo account.

<Note>
If you encounter any issues during testing, double-check your configuration settings in both the Facebook Developer Console and Aikeedo admin panel.

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully integrated Facebook as an identity provider, consider exploring other authentication options to provide your users with more choices:

- [Google Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/google)

- [GitHub Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/github)

By offering multiple login options, you can enhance user experience and potentially increase user adoption of your Aikeedo application.
