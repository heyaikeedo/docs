## Overview

Integrating LinkedIn as an identity provider offers your users a convenient and secure way to access your Aikeedo application. This feature leverages LinkedIn's OAuth 2.0 protocol, ensuring a streamlined authentication process while maintaining high security standards.

<Note>
Before you begin, ensure you have admin access to your Aikeedo application and a LinkedIn Developer account for setting up the OAuth integration.
</Note>

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Create a LinkedIn App

1. Visit the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/).
2. Click on "My Apps" in the top-right corner.
3. Select "Create App" and provide the necessary information:
   - App name
   - LinkedIn Page (company page associated with the app)
   - App logo
4. Click "Create app" to proceed.

### 2. Configure OAuth 2.0 Settings

1. In your app's dashboard, navigate to the "Auth" tab.
2. Under "OAuth 2.0 settings", you'll find your Client ID and Client Secret. Make note of these as you'll need them later.
3. In the "Authorized redirect URLs" section, enter the callback URL provided by Aikeedo.


<Tip>
Look for a click-to-copy feature in Aikeedo for easy access to the correct callback URL.
</Tip>

<Warning>
The callback URL is automatically generated based on your Site Domain and SSL settings. To configure these, visit the [Website Essentials](/website-basics/essentials) page in your Aikeedo admin panel.
</Warning>

4. Click "Update" to save your changes.

### 3. Configure App Permissions

1. In the "Products" tab, request access to the necessary LinkedIn APIs (e.g., "Sign In with LinkedIn").
2. Follow the prompts to verify your app and gain access to the required permissions.

### 4. Configure Aikeedo

1. Log into your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Identity providers > LinkedIn**.
3. Toggle the switch to enable "Login with LinkedIn".
4. Enter the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" obtained from your LinkedIn App.
5. Click "Save changes" to apply your configuration.

## Testing Your Integration

After completing the setup, it's crucial to test the integration to ensure a smooth user experience:

1. Log out of your Aikeedo application.
2. On the login page, look for the "Login with LinkedIn" option.
3. Click the option and proceed through the LinkedIn authentication flow.
4. Verify that you can successfully log in and access your Aikeedo account.

<Note>
If you encounter any issues during testing, double-check your configuration settings in both the LinkedIn Developer Console and Aikeedo admin panel.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any difficulties with the LinkedIn identity provider integration, consider the following:

- Ensure the callback URL in LinkedIn Developer Console matches exactly with the one provided by Aikeedo.
- Verify that you've requested and been granted access to the necessary LinkedIn APIs.
- Check that your app's privacy policy and terms of service URLs are set correctly in the LinkedIn App settings.

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully integrated LinkedIn as an identity provider, consider exploring other authentication options to provide your users with more choices:

- [Google Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/google)
- [Facebook Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/facebook)
- [GitHub Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/github)

By offering multiple login options, you can enhance user experience and potentially increase user adoption of your Aikeedo application.
