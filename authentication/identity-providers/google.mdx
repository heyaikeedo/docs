## Overview

Integrating Google as an identity provider offers your users a convenient and secure way to access your Aikeedo application. This feature leverages Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol, ensuring a streamlined authentication process while maintaining high security standards.

<Note>
Before you begin, ensure you have admin access to your Aikeedo application and a Google account for setting up the OAuth integration.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Create a Google API Project

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page.
3. Select "New Project" and provide a name for your project.
4. Click "Create" to generate your new Google API project.

### 2. Set Up the OAuth Consent Screen

1. In the Google Cloud Console sidebar, go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen".
2. Choose the appropriate user type for your application (Internal or External).
3. Fill in the required details:
   - App name
   - User support email
   - Developer contact information
4. Click "Save and Continue" to proceed.

### 3. Generate OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. In the sidebar, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
2. Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
3. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
4. In the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, enter the callback URL provided by Aikeedo.

<Tip>
Look for a click-to-copy feature in Aikeedo for easy access to the correct callback URL.
</Tip>

<Warning>
The callback URL is automatically generated based on your Site Domain and SSL settings. For more information, visit the [Website Essentials](/website-basics/essentials#site-domain) page.
</Warning>

5. Click "Create" to generate your OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret.
6. Make note of the generated "Client ID" and "Client Secret" - you'll need these for Aikeedo configuration.

### 4. Configure Aikeedo

1. Log into your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Identity providers > Google**.
3. Toggle the switch to enable "Login with Google".
4. Enter the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" obtained from your Google API project.
5. Click "Save changes" to apply your configuration.

## Testing Your Integration

After completing the setup, it's crucial to test the integration to ensure a smooth user experience:

1. Log out of your Aikeedo application.
2. On the login page, look for the "Login with Google" option.
3. Click the option and proceed through the Google authentication flow.
4. Verify that you can successfully log in and access your Aikeedo account.

<Note>
If you encounter any issues during testing, double-check your configuration settings in both the Google Cloud Console and Aikeedo admin panel.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any difficulties with the Google identity provider integration, consider the following:

- Ensure the callback URL in Google Cloud Console matches exactly with the one provided by Aikeedo.
- Verify that you've enabled the necessary Google APIs for your project.
- Check that your OAuth consent screen is properly configured and approved (if required).


## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully integrated Google as an identity provider, consider exploring other authentication options to provide your users with more choices:

- [Facebook Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/facebook)
- [LinkedIn Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/linkedin)
- [GitHub Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/github)

By offering multiple login options, you can enhance user experience and potentially increase user adoption of your Aikeedo application.
