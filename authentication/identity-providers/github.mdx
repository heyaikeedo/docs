## Overview

Integrating GitHub as an identity provider offers your users a convenient and secure way to access your Aikeedo application. This feature leverages GitHub's OAuth 2.0 protocol, ensuring a streamlined authentication process while maintaining high security standards.

<Note>
Before you begin, ensure you have admin access to your Aikeedo application and a GitHub account for setting up the OAuth integration.
</Note>

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Create a GitHub OAuth App

1. Visit the [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
2. Click on "OAuth Apps" in the left sidebar, then select "New OAuth App".
3. Fill out the required information:
   - Application name: Choose a name for your app
   - Homepage URL: Enter your Aikeedo application's URL
   - Authorization callback URL: Enter the callback URL provided by Aikeedo

<Tip>
Look for a click-to-copy feature in Aikeedo for easy access to the correct callback URL.
</Tip>

<Warning>
The callback URL is automatically generated based on your Site Domain and SSL settings. To configure these, visit the [Website Essentials](/website-basics/essentials) page in your Aikeedo admin panel.
</Warning>

4. Click "Register application" to create your OAuth App.

### 2. Obtain OAuth Credentials

1. After registering, you'll be taken to your app's settings page.
2. Here, you'll find your "Client ID".
3. Click "Generate a new client secret" to create your Client Secret.
4. Make note of both the Client ID and Client Secret - you'll need these for Aikeedo configuration.

<Warning>
Keep your Client Secret confidential. Never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.
</Warning>

### 3. Configure Aikeedo

1. Log into your Aikeedo admin panel.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Identity providers > GitHub**.
3. Toggle the switch to enable "Login with GitHub".
4. Enter the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" obtained from your GitHub OAuth App.
5. The Valid OAuth Redirect URI is automatically populated based on your [Website Essentials](/website-basics/essentials) settings. Ensure this matches the Authorization callback URL you entered in GitHub.
6. Click "Save changes" to apply your configuration.

## Testing Your Integration

After completing the setup, it's crucial to test the integration to ensure a smooth user experience:

1. Log out of your Aikeedo application.
2. On the login page, look for the "Login with GitHub" option.
3. Click the option and proceed through the GitHub authentication flow.
4. Verify that you can successfully log in and access your Aikeedo account.

<Note>
If you encounter any issues during testing, double-check your configuration settings in both the GitHub Developer settings and Aikeedo admin panel.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any difficulties with the GitHub identity provider integration, consider the following:

- Ensure the Authorization callback URL in GitHub Developer settings matches exactly with the one provided by Aikeedo.
- Verify that you've granted the necessary permissions to your GitHub OAuth App.
- Check that your app's privacy policy and terms of service URLs are set correctly in the GitHub App settings, if required.

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully integrated GitHub as an identity provider, consider exploring other authentication options to provide your users with more choices:

- [Google Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/google)
- [Facebook Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/facebook)
- [LinkedIn Identity Provider](/authentication/identity-providers/linkedin)

By offering multiple login options, you can enhance user experience and potentially increase user adoption of your Aikeedo application.
