Account settings control user registration, authentication, and email verification policies for your Aikeedo platform.

## General Settings

### User Accounts

This setting controls whether users can create and access accounts on your platform.

- When enabled, users can sign in through the sign-in form and API.
- If disabled, only admin accounts will be able to sign in.

<Warning>
  Disabling user accounts will prevent regular users from accessing your platform. Use this option with caution.
</Warning>

### Signup Form

This option determines whether new users can register for accounts on your platform.

- When enabled, users can sign up through the registration form and API.
- If disabled, new user registrations will be prevented, but existing users can still sign in.

<Tip>
  You might want to disable the signup form temporarily for maintenance or to control user influx.
</Tip>

## Email Verification Policy

The email verification policy determines how strictly your platform enforces email verification for new and existing users. You can choose from three levels of verification:

1. **None**: No email verification is required.
   - Users can access all features without verifying their email addresses.
   - This option provides the most frictionless user experience but offers the least security.

2. **Relaxed**: Users can sign in, but are encouraged to verify their email.
   - Users can access the platform without email verification.
   - An alert will be displayed on the dashboard indicating that the email is unverified.
   - This setting balances user convenience with a reminder to complete verification.

3. **Strict**: Email verification is mandatory before full platform access.
   - Users can sign in but cannot access any pages except account-related pages until they verify their email address.
   - This provides the highest level of security but may impact user onboarding.

<Note>
  To enable email verification (for Relaxed and Strict policies), ensure you've configured your [mailer transport](/email/mailer) in the Email settings.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The email verification policy does not apply to admin portal access. Admin accounts are managed separately for security reasons.
</Warning>

Each option offers different balances between user convenience and security, allowing you to tailor the policy to your platform's needs.


## Best Practices

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your account settings to ensure they align with your current security needs and user experience goals.

2. **User Communication**: If you make significant changes to these settings, consider notifying your users to avoid confusion.

3. **Testing**: After changing settings, test the user registration and login processes to ensure everything works as expected.

4. **Compliance**: Ensure your account settings comply with relevant data protection regulations in your jurisdiction.
