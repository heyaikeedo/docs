Account settings control user registration, authentication, and email verification policies for your Aikeedo platform.

## General Settings

### User Accounts

This setting controls whether users can create and access accounts on your platform.

- When enabled, users can sign in through the sign-in form and API.
- If disabled, only admin accounts will be able to sign in.

<Warning>
  Disabling user accounts will prevent regular users from accessing your platform. Use this option with caution.
</Warning>

### Signup Form

This option determines whether new users can register for accounts on your platform.

- When enabled, users can sign up through the registration form and API.
- If disabled, new user registrations will be prevented, but existing users can still sign in.

<Tip>
  You might want to disable the signup form temporarily for maintenance or to control user influx.
</Tip>

### Phone Number Collection

Configure whether to collect phone numbers during user registration.

**Available Options:**
- **None**: Phone number collection is disabled for user registration
- **Optional**: Users can optionally provide their phone number
- **Mandatory**: Phone number is required for registration

**Phone Number Collection Purpose:**
When phone number collection is enabled (Optional or Mandatory), you can provide a purpose statement that will be displayed to users during registration.

- **Purpose**: Explain why you need to collect phone numbers
- **Display**: This message will be shown to end users during registration
- **Optional**: Leave blank to hide the explanation
- **Recommended**: Explain the purpose to build trust and compliance

<Note>
  This setting applies to new registrations only and does not affect existing user accounts.
</Note>

### Disposable Email Domains

Control whether users can register with disposable email addresses.

- **Enabled**: Users can sign up with disposable email domains
- **Disabled**: Registration with disposable email domains is blocked

**Default Protection:**
Aikeedo blocks 2500+ disposable email domains by default, and this list improves with each update to provide better protection against spam registrations.

**Adding Additional Blocked Domains:**
If you need to block additional disposable email domains, you can add them to the `/data/domains.txt` file:

1. Navigate to your Aikeedo installation directory
2. Open or create the `/data/domains.txt` file
3. Add each domain on a new line
4. Save the file

These domains will be added to the default block list.

<Note>
  This setting applies to new registrations only and does not affect existing user accounts.
</Note>

### Owned Workspace Cap

Limit the number of workspaces a user can own.

- Enter a number to set the maximum limit
- Leave blank or set to "Unlimited" for no limit
- This helps control resource usage and prevents workspace spam

## Email Verification Policy

The email verification policy determines how strictly your platform enforces email verification for new and existing users. You can choose from three levels of verification:

1. **None**: No email verification is required.
   - Users can access all features without verifying their email addresses.
   - This option provides the most frictionless user experience but offers the least security.

2. **Relaxed**: Users can sign in, but are encouraged to verify their email.
   - Users can access the platform without email verification.
   - An alert will be displayed on the dashboard indicating that the email is unverified.
   - This setting balances user convenience with a reminder to complete verification.

3. **Strict**: Email verification is mandatory before full platform access.
   - Users can sign in but cannot access any pages except account-related pages until they verify their email address.
   - This provides the highest level of security but may impact user onboarding.

<Note>
  To enable email verification (for Relaxed and Strict policies), ensure you've configured your [mailer transport](/email/mailer) in the Email settings.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The email verification policy does not apply to admin portal access. Admin accounts are managed separately for security reasons.
</Warning>

### OAuth Email Status

Control how email verification is handled for OAuth (social login) users.

**Available Options:**
- **Ignore**: Email verification status from the identity provider will be ignored
- **Auto**: Email will be marked as verified if verified by the identity provider
- **Verified**: Email will be marked as verified when signing in through an identity provider even if it is not verified by the identity provider

Each option offers different balances between user convenience and security, allowing you to tailor the policy to your platform's needs.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your account settings to ensure they align with your current security needs and user experience goals.

2. **User Communication**: If you make significant changes to these settings, consider notifying your users to avoid confusion.

3. **Testing**: After changing settings, test the user registration and login processes to ensure everything works as expected.

4. **Compliance**: Ensure your account settings comply with relevant data protection regulations in your jurisdiction.
